A boss minifigure walks in through the door with a shocked expression. Tiny Lego computers, water cooler, motivational poster on the wall. Shot like a dramatic movie still with cinematic lighting. Comedy meets corporate life in brick form." },

Miniature waterfalls flowing over moss-covered rocks, tiny handmade trees with wire trunks, a small wooden bridge crossing a resin river. Tiny LED fairy lights woven through. Morning mist effect with dry ice. Shot with a macro lens — the glass jar edges visible, a laptop blurred in the background for scale. Magical, cozy, impossibly detailed." },

Tiny Christmas tree with LED lights, a fireplace with real orange glow, a miniature armchair with a tiny knitted blanket. Snowflakes frozen mid-fall inside the glass.

I want the non-obvious revenue levers that require zero new customers.\n\nMy business: [DESCRIBE — what you sell, to whom, how much revenue, how you deliver]\n\nAnalyze these 5 hidden revenue zones:\n1. PRICING ARCHITECTURE — Am I accidentally anchoring too low? Could I restructure the same offering into tiers that capture more willingness-to-pay?\n2. BACK-END OFFERS — What could I sell to existing customers that I'm not? What's the natural 'what next?' after they buy from me?\n3. PARTNERSHIP MATH — Who already has my ideal customers' attention? What would a revenue-share deal look like with them?\n4. PACKAGING ARBITRAGE — Am I selling ingredients when I should be selling meals? (e.g. selling prompts vs. selling 'the complete system')\n5. SPEED PREMIUM — What would people pay 2-3x more for if they could get it faster or with done-for-you implementation?\n\nFor each zone: state the opportunity in one sentence, estimate the revenue impact (conservative), and give me the exact first action to take tomorrow morning." },
      { title: "The 'Objection Destroyer' Sales Script", prompt: "I need to handle sales objections for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE at PRICE]. But I don't want generic rebuttals — I want to understand the psychology behind each objection and disarm it before it's even raised.\n\nFirst, list the 8 most common objections for a product like mine (ranked by how often they kill the sale). For each one:\n- THE REAL OBJECTION: What they say vs. what they actually mean (these are always different)\n- THE REFRAME: A single sentence that shifts their perspective without being pushy\n- THE PROOF POINT: What evidence, story, or demonstration would eliminate this objection permanently?\n- THE PREEMPTIVE STRIKE: How do I address this in my marketing/copy so they never even think it?\n\nThen write a 60-second elevator pitch for my product that preemptively destroys the top 3 objections before anyone can raise them. The pitch should sound conversational, not salesy." },
      { title: "The 'Content Engine' System Prompt", prompt: "I want to set up a system where I spend 30 minutes per day on content and get 10x the output of someone spending 3 hours. Build me the complete system.\n\nMy niche: [YOUR NICHE]\nMy goal: [LEADS / BRAND / SALES / AUTHORITY]\nPlatforms I'm on: [LIST THEM]\nMy unfair advantage: [WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T?]\n\nDesign a system with:\n1. IDEA BANK — 20 content ideas I can execute this month, categorized by platform and format. Each idea should have the hook, the main point, and the CTA pre-written in one sentence each.\n2. THE DAILY WORKFLOW — A step-by-step 30-minute routine: minute 0-10 (create), minute 10-20 (repurpose), minute 20-30 (distribute + engage). Be specific about what tool to use at each step.\n3. THE RECYCLING SYSTEM — How to take my best-performing content and turn it into 5 new pieces without it feeling repetitive.\n4. THE MEASUREMENT CHEAT SHEET — The only 3 metrics I should track (ignore everything else), what 'good' looks like for each, and when to pivot vs. double down.\n\nI don't want theory. I want a system I can start using tomorrow morning at 8am." },
