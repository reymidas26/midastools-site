    betrayal: `The scene depicts a romantic betrayal storyline: ${food1} has just discovered ${food2} was secretly seeing another food behind their back. ${food1} is confronting ${food2} with heartbreak and fury. There should be dramatic tears (juice drops), accusatory pointing, and a third food character partially visible in the background looking guilty.`,
    cooking: `The scene is an intense cooking competition: ${food1} and ${food2} are rival contestants on a dramatic cooking show. They stand at opposing prep stations, glaring at each other with competitive fire. A chef judge looms ominously in the background. One is clearly sabotaging the other's dish.`,
    office: `The scene is an office workplace drama: ${food1} and ${food2} work in a tiny food-office cubicle. ${food1} just got the promotion that ${food2} deserved. There are passive-aggressive sticky notes, a "Employee of the Month" photo being torn down, and watercooler gossip happening in the background.`,
    reality: `The scene is a reality TV confessional: ${food1} is sitting in the confessional chair, talking directly to camera about ${food2}. Split screen showing ${food2} doing something shady in the background. Reality TV style graphics, dramatic captions, and a "PREVIOUSLY ON..." banner.`,
    crime: `The scene is a crime thriller / kitchen noir: A dramatic crime scene on the cutting board. ${food1} is the detective investigating, wearing a tiny detective hat and holding a magnifying glass. ${food2} is the prime suspect, sweating nervously. Yellow crime tape, dramatic shadows, and knife marks as evidence.`,
    comedy: `The scene is a comedy sitcom: ${food1} and ${food2} are roommates in a classic sitcom setup. ${food1} just did something ridiculous and ${food2} is doing a deadpan stare at the camera (breaking the fourth wall). Laugh track energy, bright sitcom lighting, a couch, and a live studio audience of tiny foods.`,
    telenovela: `The scene is a dramatic telenovela: ${food1} and ${food2} in an intense close-up confrontation with extreme dramatic zoom. ${food1} is gasping with one hand on their chest. ${food2} is revealing a shocking secret. Rain is falling indoors for no reason. Dramatic Spanish guitar music implied through visual cues. Extreme lighting contrasts.`,
    horror: `The scene is a horror kitchen scenario: ${food1} and ${food2} are hiding behind a pepper grinder, terrified. A giant chef's knife casts a shadow over them. The kitchen is dark with dramatic backlighting from the stove. One of them is whispering "don't move." Horror movie poster composition with unsettling shadows.`,

  const toneInstructions = {
    dramatic: `The emotional tone is MAXIMUM over-the-top dramatic — exaggerated facial expressions, dramatic lighting with rim lights and shadows, wind blowing for no reason, tears glistening, heroic/tragic poses. Think Oscar-bait movie poster energy.`,
    'dark-comedy': `The emotional tone is dark comedy — the situation is objectively terrible but presented in a funny, absurd way. Deadpan expressions mixed with horrifying situations. The humor comes from the contrast between the cute food characters and the dark subject matter.`,
    wholesome: `The emotional tone is wholesome and cute — even the drama is adorable. Big sparkly eyes, soft pastel accents, the conflict is mild and sweet. Both characters are lovable even when arguing. Studio Ghibli meets Pixar warmth.`,
    sarcastic: `The emotional tone is sarcastic and petty — eye-rolling, side-eye glances, crossed arms, smug expressions. The drama is fueled by passive-aggressive behavior and shade-throwing. Think Real Housewives energy but with food.`,
    tearful: `The emotional tone is tearful soap opera — mascara running (or juice dripping), clutching a tiny tissue, dramatic fainting poses, reaching out in despair. Rain on the window. Soft focus. Every emotion is cranked to 11.`,
    thriller: `The emotional tone is tense thriller suspense — tight framing, Dutch angles, shadows hiding half the face, nervous glances, something lurking just off-screen. The mood is uneasy. A clock ticking. Sweat drops on the characters.`,
  };

  const sceneInstructions = {
    counter: `The setting is a kitchen counter — granite or marble surface, everyday kitchen items in the background (salt shaker, olive oil bottle, paper towels). The counter is their stage, their world.`,
    fridge: `The setting is INSIDE a refrigerator — cool blue lighting, shelves visible, condiment bottles as background characters, the fridge light creating dramatic illumination. The door is slightly ajar casting a beam of warm light.`,
    grocery: `The setting is a grocery store aisle — fluorescent overhead lighting, product shelves towering like skyscrapers, a shopping cart in the background, price tags visible. Other foods watch from the shelves like an audience.`,
    'cutting-board': `The setting is on a cutting board — wooden cutting board surface with visible knife marks (scars of fallen foods). A knife looms ominously at the edge of frame. This is where the stakes are literally life and death. Vegetable peels scattered like crime scene evidence.`,
    restaurant: `The setting is a professional restaurant kitchen — stainless steel surfaces, hanging pots, the pass with order tickets, steam rising, the chaos of a dinner rush. Gordon Ramsay energy.`,
    'farmers-market': `The setting is an outdoor farmer's market — striped tent canopies, wooden crates, sunlight streaming through, hand-written price signs, a crowd of other produce watching from their baskets.`,
    'food-truck': `The setting is inside a food truck — cramped space, a tiny service window showing the outside world, menu board visible, sizzling sounds implied. Tight quarters make the drama inescapable.`,
    'dinner-table': `The setting is a formal dinner table — white tablecloth, candles, fine china, wine glasses (filled with vinaigrette). A formal setting for extremely informal, chaotic behavior. Other food guests are frozen mid-gasp.`,

CHARACTERS:
- Character 1: ${icon1} ${food1} — a fully anthropomorphic ${food1.toLowerCase()} with human-like arms, legs, hands, and an expressive face with large emotional eyes, a mouth capable of speaking, and exaggerated facial expressions. The ${food1.toLowerCase()} retains its natural food shape and color/texture but has a complete humanoid body structure. Wearing small clothing accessories that match their personality.
- Character 2: ${icon2} ${food2} — a fully anthropomorphic ${food2.toLowerCase()} with the same level of humanization. Expressive face, limbs, clothing accessories. Their body is the shape of a ${food2.toLowerCase()} but with full human range of motion and emotion.

SCENE & GENRE:
${genreInstructions[genre] || genreInstructions.betrayal}

SETTING:
${sceneInstructions[scene] || sceneInstructions.counter}

EMOTIONAL TONE:
${toneInstructions[tone] || toneInstructions.dramatic}

VIDEO DIRECTION:
The camera starts with a wide establishing shot, then dramatically zooms into a close-up of ${food1}'s face showing their emotional reaction. ${food2} gestures dramatically. The scene should feel like a viral TikTok/Instagram Reel — punchy, expressive, and meme-worthy.

DIALOGUE SUGGESTIONS (add as text overlays or subtitles):
- ${food1}: "I can't believe you'd do this to me... after everything we've been through in the crisper drawer."
- ${food2}: "You never understood me! You just wanted me for my flavor!"
- ${food1}: "We're DONE. I'm moving to the pantry."

STYLE: Pixar/Illumination quality 3D animation, cinematic dramatic lighting, shallow depth of field, vibrant saturated colors. The food characters should look like they belong in a DreamWorks animated film. Hyper-detailed textures on the food surfaces (visible seeds on the strawberry, bumps on the avocado skin, etc.)

TECHNICAL: 16:9 aspect ratio for TikTok/Reels vertical crop compatibility. 24fps cinematic motion. Dramatic orchestral or telenovela music implied through visual pacing.

This is for the viral FoodTok trend — anthropomorphic fruits and vegetables acting out dramatic soap opera scenes. Make it screenshot-worthy, meme-worthy, and instantly shareable.`;

CHARACTERS:
- Character 1: ${icon1} ${food1} — a fully anthropomorphic ${food1.toLowerCase()} with human-like arms, legs, hands, and an extremely expressive face. Large emotional eyes (think Pixar-style), a mouth capable of dramatic expressions, tiny eyebrows for maximum emotion. The ${food1.toLowerCase()} retains its natural food shape, color, and texture (visible seeds, skin texture, etc.) but has a complete humanoid body. Wearing small clothing accessories that reflect their personality — maybe a tiny jacket, scarf, or hat.
- Character 2: ${icon2} ${food2} — a fully anthropomorphic ${food2.toLowerCase()} with the same level of humanization. Expressive face with big emotional eyes, limbs, and small clothing accessories. Their body is shaped like a ${food2.toLowerCase()} but with full human range of emotion and gesture. Their outfit contrasts with ${food1}'s personality.

SCENE & GENRE:
${genreInstructions[genre] || genreInstructions.betrayal}

SETTING:
${sceneInstructions[scene] || sceneInstructions.counter}

EMOTIONAL TONE:
${toneInstructions[tone] || toneInstructions.dramatic}

COMPOSITION:
Frame the scene like a movie poster or key dramatic moment. The two food characters should be the clear focal point, with the setting providing context and atmosphere. Include small background details that reward closer inspection (other tiny food characters reacting, relevant props, environmental storytelling).

DIALOGUE SUGGESTIONS (include as speech bubbles or text overlays):
- ${food1}: "I can't believe you'd do this to me... after everything we've been through in the crisper drawer."
- ${food2}: "You never understood me! You just wanted me for my flavor!"
- ${food1}: "We're DONE. I'm moving to the pantry."

STYLE: Pixar/Illumination quality 3D render OR high-quality digital illustration. Cinematic dramatic lighting with rim lights, volumetric atmosphere, and depth of field. Vibrant, saturated colors. The food characters should look like they belong in a DreamWorks or Pixar short film. Hyper-detailed textures on the food surfaces (visible seeds, bumps, skin pores, etc.) contrasted with smooth, expressive cartoon faces.

The overall image should be instantly shareable on TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter. It should make people laugh, screenshot it, and tag their friends. This is for the viral FoodTok trend of anthropomorphic food drama — make it meme-worthy, emotionally intense, and impossibly cute at the same time.`;
