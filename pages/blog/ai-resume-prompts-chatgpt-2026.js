The prompts in this guide are designed to produce ATS-optimized, recruiter-tested resume content that actually gets interviews.'

The content is still your real experience, achievements, and skills — AI just helps you present them more effectively.

        </h1>

        {/* ============================================ */}
        {/* INTRO                                        */}
        {/* ============================================ */}

        <p>Here is the reality of job searching in 2026: <strong>75% of resumes are rejected by ATS software before a human ever reads them</strong>. The average corporate job posting receives 250+ applications. Recruiters spend 6&ndash;7 seconds scanning the resumes that make it through.</p>

        <p>If your resume is not keyword-optimized, achievement-focused, and formatted for both machines and humans, you are invisible. It does not matter how qualified you are.</p>

        <p>The good news? ChatGPT can transform your resume from a generic list of job duties into a targeted, ATS-optimized document that actually gets interviews &mdash; if you know how to prompt it correctly.</p>

        <p>Most people type &ldquo;write me a resume&rdquo; and get garbage. The prompts below are different. They use proven frameworks &mdash; the XYZ formula for achievements, STAR method for behavioral answers, value-based positioning for salary negotiation &mdash; and they are designed to be customized with your real experience.</p>

        <p>Every prompt includes <strong>[brackets]</strong> where you fill in your details. Copy the prompt, replace the brackets, paste into ChatGPT (or <Link href="/prompt-generator" style={{ color: '#3B5FFF' }}>our free prompt generator</Link>), and get results in seconds.</p>

        <p>These 15 prompts cover the entire job search pipeline: resume writing, cover letters, LinkedIn, interviews, and salary negotiation.</p>

        {/* ============================================ */}

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Why AI Is the New Resume Advantage</h2>

        <p>The job market has fundamentally changed. Here are the numbers that matter:</p>

        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          <li><strong>75% of resumes</strong> are filtered out by ATS before reaching a human recruiter (Jobscan, 2026).</li>
          <li><strong>63% of recruiters</strong> prefer resumes tailored to the specific job description (LinkedIn Talent Solutions).</li>
          <li>The average job seeker spends <strong>11 hours per week</strong> on applications. AI cuts that to under 3.</li>
          <li>Candidates who tailor their resume to each job posting are <strong>3x more likely</strong> to get an interview.</li>
          <li><strong>40% of hiring managers</strong> say a strong LinkedIn profile influenced their decision to interview a candidate.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The people landing multiple interviews right now are not necessarily more qualified than you. They are using AI to produce more applications, at higher quality, in less time. A tailored resume that took someone 2 hours to write manually can be generated in 5 minutes with the right prompt.</p>

        <p>That is not cheating. That is leverage. The same way a calculator does not make you bad at math, AI prompts do not make you less qualified &mdash; they help you present your real experience in the most compelling way possible.</p>

        <p>Let us get into the prompts.</p>

        <p>These prompts transform your experience into achievement-focused, ATS-optimized bullet points that recruiters actually want to read. Each one targets a different part of the resume writing process.</p>

        {/* PROMPT 1 */}
        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>1. The ATS Keyword Optimizer</h3>
        <p>This is the single most impactful prompt for getting past ATS filters. It extracts the exact keywords from a job description and weaves them into your existing resume bullets.</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`I'm applying for [Job Title] at [Company Name]. Here is the job description:

[Paste the full job description]

Here is my current resume:

[Paste your current resume text]

Do the following:
1. Extract the top 20 keywords and phrases from the job description that an ATS would scan for (hard skills, tools, certifications, industry terms).
2. Identify which of these keywords are already in my resume and which are missing.
3. Rewrite my bullet points to naturally incorporate the missing keywords WITHOUT fabricating experience I don't have.
4. For each bullet point, lead with a strong action verb and use the XYZ formula: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]."
5. Keep each bullet point under 2 lines.
6. Flag any keywords from the job description that I genuinely cannot claim — I'll need to address those in my cover letter instead.`}

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>2. The Achievement Bullet Point Rewriter</h3>

{`I need to rewrite my resume bullet points to focus on achievements instead of duties. I work in [Your Industry] as a [Your Current/Recent Job Title].

Here are my current bullet points:
[Paste your existing bullet points]

For each bullet point:
1. Rewrite it using the XYZ achievement formula: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]."
2. Start each bullet with a powerful action verb (led, built, increased, reduced, launched, negotiated, automated, designed).
3. Add specific metrics. If I didn't provide numbers, suggest realistic placeholders I can fill in (e.g., "increased sales by [X]%" or "managed a team of [X]").
4. Remove all passive language ("responsible for," "helped with," "assisted in").
5. Keep each bullet to one line, maximum two.
6. Prioritize bullets that demonstrate impact on revenue, efficiency, team growth, or cost savings.

Output the rewritten bullets in a clean, copy-paste-ready format.`}

        {/* PROMPT 3 */}
        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>3. The Professional Summary Generator</h3>
        <p>The summary at the top of your resume is the first thing a recruiter reads (if they read at all). This prompt writes one that hooks them in 3 seconds.</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Write a professional resume summary for a [Your Job Title] with [X years] of experience in [Your Industry/Field].

- [Strength 3, e.g., "driving $1M+ revenue growth through product launches"]

I'm targeting roles in [Target Role/Industry] at companies like [Company Name or Company Type].

Write 3 versions of a 3-4 sentence professional summary:
- Version A: Emphasizes technical skills and tools
- Version B: Emphasizes leadership and business impact
- Version C: Emphasizes industry expertise and domain knowledge

Each version should:
- Open with a strong identity statement (not "Results-driven professional" — that's cliche)
- Include 2-3 quantified achievements
- Name specific tools, technologies, or methodologies relevant to [Target Role]
- End with what I'm looking for (without sounding desperate)
- Be ATS-friendly with natural keyword inclusion`}

{`I'm changing careers from [Current Industry/Role] to [Target Industry/Role].

Here's my current experience:

Here's a job description for the role I want:
[Paste the target job description]

Do the following:
1. Identify every transferable skill from my current experience that maps to the target role. Be specific — not just "communication skills" but exactly how my experience demonstrates what they need.
2. Rewrite my bullet points to emphasize the transferable skills using language from the TARGET industry, not my current one.
3. Suggest a professional summary that positions my career change as a strategic move, not a desperate pivot.
4. Identify 2-3 gaps between my experience and the job requirements. For each gap, suggest how I can address it (online course, project, certification) and what to say in my cover letter.
5. Recommend which experiences to lead with and which to de-emphasize or remove entirely.
6. Reorder my resume sections to put the most relevant information first.`}

1. FIRST IMPRESSION: What is your gut reaction in the first 6 seconds? What stands out (good or bad)?
2. ATS COMPATIBILITY: Are there any formatting issues that would cause ATS parsing errors? (tables, columns, headers, special characters, graphics)
3. IMPACT: Which bullet points demonstrate real impact? Which ones are filler that should be cut or rewritten?
4. LANGUAGE: Flag any cliches ("results-driven," "team player," "detail-oriented"), passive voice, or weak verbs.
5. GAPS: What's missing that a recruiter would expect to see for this role?
6. LENGTH: Is it the right length for my experience level? What should be cut?
7. ORDER: Are sections in the right priority order for my target role?

[Paste your current LinkedIn experience bullets or resume bullets for this role]

Rewrite this for LinkedIn specifically:
1. Write a 2-3 sentence overview paragraph that explains the SCOPE of the role (team size, budget, what I owned) and the BIGGEST result I achieved.
2. Below that, write 4-6 bullet points that highlight achievements with metrics.
3. Use LinkedIn-searchable keywords throughout: [list 5-7 keywords recruiters in your field search for, e.g., "product management, agile, roadmap planning, user research, OKRs"].
4. Make the tone slightly more conversational than a resume — this is a professional social profile, not a formal document.
5. Bold the most impressive metrics (LinkedIn supports basic formatting).
6. End with a line about what the role taught me or how it shaped my approach — this adds personality.

Format it exactly as it should appear on LinkedIn, with the paragraph first and bullets below.`}

My background: [One sentence about you and what's relevant]

Write 3 versions of a LinkedIn connection request (max 300 characters):
- Version A: Reference something specific from their profile or recent post
- Version B: Reference a shared connection, school, or experience
- Version C: Lead with a genuine question about their work

Then write a follow-up message for AFTER they accept (max 150 words):
- Thank them for connecting
- Add value first (share a resource, insight, or genuine compliment about their work)
- Make a soft ask (15-minute call, not a job request)
- Make it easy to say yes by suggesting specific times

Tone: Genuine, human, zero desperation. I'm building a professional relationship, not asking for a favor.`}

- Size: [Approximate number of employees]

PART 1 — Company Research Brief:
Give me a 5-minute briefing on this company as if you're a career coach prepping me. Include:
- What they do and who their customers are
- Their competitive advantages and biggest challenges
- Recent strategic moves and what they signal about the company's direction
- The likely pain points of the team I'd be joining
- The company culture signals I should be aware of

PART 2 — 10 Interview Questions I Should Ask:
Write 10 questions I can ask my interviewers, organized by who I'm talking to:
- 3 questions for the hiring manager (about the team, expectations, success metrics)
- 3 questions for a peer/team member (about day-to-day work, culture, challenges)
- 2 questions for a senior leader/VP (about company direction, growth, strategy)
- 2 "closer" questions that subtly demonstrate I'm already thinking about how to contribute

- My target salary: $[Amount]
- Location: [City/Remote]
- My years of experience: [X years]
- Industry: [Your Industry]

Do the following:

PART 1 — Market Research:
Based on the role, location, experience level, and industry, provide:
- The typical salary range for this role (low / median / high)
- 3 data points I can reference in my negotiation (cite sources like Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Payscale, or industry benchmarks)
- Whether the offer is below, at, or above market rate

PART 2 — Counter-Offer Email:
Write a counter-offer email that:
1. Opens with genuine enthusiasm for the role and team (this is critical — never lead with money)
2. Acknowledges the offer respectfully
3. Presents my target salary with 2-3 data-backed reasons (market rate, my specific achievements, the value I'll bring)
4. Mentions 2-3 alternative compensation levers if base salary is firm: signing bonus, equity/RSUs, extra PTO, remote flexibility, professional development budget, earlier review cycle
5. Maintains a collaborative tone throughout — "I want to find a number that works for both of us," not an ultimatum
6. Ends with a clear next step

PART 3 — Negotiation Talking Points:
Give me 5 talking points in case they want to discuss on a call instead of email. Include responses to common pushbacks:
- "This is the max for the band"
- "We don't negotiate for this level"
- "The budget is set"

Tone: Confident, professional, collaborative. Not aggressive, not apologetic.`}

Generate:

1. A one-page "Impact Document" I can share with my manager that lists my contributions organized by business impact (revenue generated, costs saved, efficiency improved, team/culture contributions). Format it as a professional document, not a brag sheet.

2. A script for the actual conversation:
   - How to open the meeting (set the right tone)
   - How to present my case (lead with value delivered, not "I need more money")
   - How to state my target number with confidence
   - How to handle "not in the budget right now" (get a timeline and commitment in writing)
   - How to handle "you're already at the top of the band" (discuss title change or promotion path)
   - How to close the conversation regardless of outcome (stay professional, get next steps)

3. A follow-up email template to send after the conversation that documents what was discussed and any commitments made.

Tone: Confident and factual. This is a business discussion, not a personal favor.`}

        <p>Every prompt above works across industries, but you will get significantly better results by adding industry-specific context. Here is how to adapt them:</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tech and Software Engineering</h3>
        <p>Add your tech stack (languages, frameworks, cloud platforms). Mention system scale (&ldquo;served 10M daily active users&rdquo;). Include GitHub contributions, open-source work, or patents. Reference specific methodologies (Agile, Scrum, CI/CD). Quantify in terms of latency reduction, uptime improvement, deployment frequency.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Finance and Accounting</h3>
        <p>Reference AUM (assets under management), portfolio performance, deal sizes, or audit scope. Mention certifications (CPA, CFA, Series 7/63). Include regulatory knowledge (SOX, GAAP, IFRS). Quantify in terms of P&amp;L impact, cost savings, compliance rates, or revenue from deals closed.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Healthcare</h3>
        <p>Include patient volume, clinical outcomes, or satisfaction scores. Mention EMR systems (Epic, Cerner). Reference certifications and licensure. Quantify in terms of patient outcomes improved, wait times reduced, compliance scores, or grant funding secured.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Marketing and Sales</h3>
        <p>Lead with revenue metrics: pipeline generated, deals closed, CAC reduced, LTV increased. Mention platforms (HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Ads). Include campaign results with specific ROAS or conversion rate improvements. Reference customer segments and market sizes.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Education</h3>
        <p>Include student outcomes (test scores, graduation rates, placement rates). Mention curriculum development, grant writing, and technology integration. Reference class sizes and program scope. Quantify in terms of student achievement gains, programs launched, or funding secured.</p>

        <p style={{ marginTop: '24px' }}>The key principle: <strong>replace generic metrics with the metrics your industry actually cares about.</strong> A recruiter in finance does not care about &ldquo;improved team efficiency.&rdquo; They care about &ldquo;managed a $50M fixed income portfolio with 12.4% annualized returns.&rdquo; The more specific your inputs, the more specific (and useful) the AI outputs.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Can ChatGPT write a resume for me?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but the quality depends entirely on your prompt. &ldquo;Write me a resume&rdquo; produces generic, unusable output. The prompts in this guide use specific frameworks (XYZ achievement formula, ATS keyword extraction, STAR method) that produce professional-quality results. You still need to provide your real experience and achievements &mdash; AI structures and polishes them, it does not invent them.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Will an AI-written resume pass ATS screening?</h3>
        <p>Yes, if prompted correctly. ATS scans for keyword matches between your resume and the job description. Prompt #1 in this guide specifically extracts ATS keywords from job postings and incorporates them into your bullet points. The key is using plain-text formatting (no tables, columns, or graphics), standard section headers, and natural keyword placement &mdash; all of which these prompts handle.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Is it ethical to use AI to write my resume?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. It is no different from using a resume template, hiring a professional resume writer, or using Grammarly. The content is your real experience and skills &mdash; AI helps you present them more effectively. Recruiters care about whether your qualifications match the role, not whether you used a tool to improve your writing. That said, never fabricate experience or skills.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>What AI tool is best for resume writing in 2026?</h3>
        <p>ChatGPT (GPT-4o) and Claude are both excellent. ChatGPT handles structured formatting well. Claude produces more natural, conversational language. Both work with every prompt in this guide. Use whichever you prefer &mdash; or try both and compare outputs. For power users, our <Link href="/prompt-generator" style={{ color: '#3B5FFF' }}>free Prompt Generator</Link> helps you build custom prompts for any AI tool.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>How many resume versions should I have?</h3>
        <p>One master resume with everything, plus a tailored version for every job you apply to. With AI prompts, tailoring takes 5 minutes instead of 2 hours. Candidates who customize per job description are 3x more likely to get interviews. Use Prompt #1 to quickly generate targeted versions by extracting keywords from each job posting.</p>
