Generic prompts like "write me a marketing email" produce generic results. The prompts in this guide include specific frameworks — PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution), AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action), and curiosity-driven subject line formulas — that consistently produce emails with above-average open and click-through rates. You still need to customize with your brand voice and specific offer details, but AI handles the heavy lifting of structure, persuasion psychology, and copywriting best practices.'

Claude produces more natural, conversational copy that avoids the typical "AI voice." For email-specific tools, Jasper and Copy.ai offer built-in email templates, but the prompts in this guide work with any AI tool and give you more control over the output. For best results, use a paid tier (ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro) to avoid usage limits during campaign creation sprints.'

          '@type': 'Answer',
          text: 'The secret is in your prompt. Most AI-written emails sound robotic because the prompt was generic. To get natural-sounding copy: (1) Include your brand voice guidelines in the prompt — specify tone, reading level, and whether you use contractions, humor, or emojis. (2) Provide examples of emails you have sent that performed well and ask AI to match that style. (3) Always include a "write like a real person talking to a friend" instruction. (4) Edit the output — use AI for the first draft and add your personal touches. (5) Read it out loud. If it sounds like something you would never say, rewrite that section. The prompts in this guide include voice and tone instructions to avoid the robotic problem from the start.'

Email 2 (Day 1-2): Share your origin story or brand mission. Email 3 (Day 3-4): Provide a quick win or valuable tip. Email 4 (Day 5-7): Share social proof (testimonials, case studies, results).

(2) Click-through rate (CTR) — benchmark is 2-5%; body copy and CTA placement drive this. (3) Conversion rate — the percentage of clickers who take the desired action (purchase, sign up, book a call). (4) Unsubscribe rate — should stay below 0.5% per send; high unsubscribes mean your content does not match subscriber expectations. (5) Revenue per email — the ultimate metric; track how much revenue each email or sequence generates. When testing AI prompts, send A/B tests with at least 1,000 subscribers per variant to get statistically significant results. Test one variable at a time: subject line, then body copy, then CTA.'

        {/* ============================================ */}
        {/* INTRO                                        */}
        {/* ============================================ */}

        <p>Email marketing is not dead. It is the <strong>highest-ROI marketing channel that exists</strong> &mdash; and it is not even close.</p>

        <p>For every $1 spent on email marketing, the average return is $36&ndash;$42 (DMA, 2026). No other channel &mdash; not social media, not paid ads, not SEO &mdash; comes close to that ratio. Your email list is the only marketing asset you truly own. Algorithm changes cannot take it away. Platform bans cannot erase it. It sits in your subscriber&rsquo;s inbox, waiting to be opened, every single day.</p>

        <p>The problem? <strong>Writing great emails is hard.</strong> You stare at a blank screen. You wrestle with subject lines. You agonize over whether your CTA is compelling enough. You spend 3 hours crafting a single email, send it to 10,000 people, and get a 1.8% click-through rate. That is 180 clicks for 3 hours of work.</p>

        <p>AI changes the math completely. With the right prompts, you can draft an entire 7-email welcome sequence in 30 minutes. You can generate 20 subject line variations and A/B test the best ones. You can write a cold outreach email that sounds like you spent an hour researching the prospect &mdash; because you instructed the AI to do that research for you.</p>

        <p>But &ldquo;write me a marketing email&rdquo; produces garbage. Generic prompts produce generic emails that get ignored, deleted, or unsubscribed from. The prompts in this guide are different. Each one includes <strong>proven copywriting frameworks</strong> &mdash; PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution), AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action), curiosity gaps, social proof stacking, and urgency triggers &mdash; baked directly into the prompt structure.</p>

        <p>Every prompt uses <strong>[BRACKETS]</strong> for the details you fill in. Copy the prompt, replace the brackets with your specifics, paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or <Link href="/prompt-generator" style={{ color: '#3B5FFF' }}>our free Prompt Generator</Link>, and get a polished email draft in seconds.</p>

        <p>These 20 prompts cover the five core email marketing categories: welcome sequences, sales and promotions, newsletters and content, cold outreach, and retention campaigns. Let us get into it.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        {/* ============================================ */}
        {/* WHY EMAIL + AI = HIGHEST ROI                */}
        {/* ============================================ */}

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Why Email Marketing + AI Is the Highest-ROI Combo in 2026</h2>

        <p>Before we get to the prompts, here are the numbers that explain why smart marketers are obsessing over AI-powered email in 2026:</p>

        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          <li><strong>$36&ndash;$42 return per $1 spent</strong> on email marketing (DMA/Litmus, 2026). Social media averages $2.80. Paid search averages $8.</li>
          <li><strong>4.5 billion email users</strong> worldwide &mdash; more than Instagram, TikTok, and X combined (Statista, 2026).</li>
          <li><strong>77% of consumers</strong> prefer email for receiving promotional content from brands they follow (HubSpot State of Marketing).</li>
          <li>Automated email sequences generate <strong>320% more revenue</strong> than non-automated emails (Campaign Monitor).</li>
          <li>Personalized subject lines increase open rates by <strong>26%</strong>, and AI can generate personalized variations at scale in seconds.</li>
          <li>Marketers who use AI for email copy report spending <strong>60% less time</strong> on first drafts while maintaining or improving performance metrics.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The math is simple: email already has the highest ROI of any marketing channel. AI makes you 3&ndash;5x faster at producing email content. Faster production means more testing. More testing means better performance. Better performance means more revenue from the same list.</p>

        <p>The marketers who are winning right now are not the ones with the biggest lists. They are the ones who can produce, test, and iterate on email campaigns faster than everyone else. AI is the lever that makes that possible.</p>

        <p>Now, the prompts.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <p>Your welcome sequence is the single most important email series you will ever write. New subscribers open welcome emails at <strong>50&ndash;86% rates</strong> &mdash; 4x higher than regular campaigns. This is your best shot at making a first impression, building trust, and driving an early purchase. Mess it up, and you lose that subscriber forever.</p>

        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`I need a 7-email welcome sequence for my [BUSINESS TYPE, e.g., "SaaS company," "e-commerce store," "coaching business," "newsletter"].

About my business:
- What I sell: [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE, e.g., "online course on productivity systems," "handmade leather goods," "marketing automation software"]

- Brand voice: [TONE, e.g., "casual and funny," "professional but warm," "bold and direct," "empathetic and supportive"]

Write 7 emails with the following structure:

EMAIL 1 — INSTANT DELIVERY (sent immediately):
- Deliver the lead magnet/welcome gift
- Set expectations for what they'll receive and how often
- One personal detail about me/the brand that builds connection
- Subject line that gets 50%+ open rate

EMAIL 2 — ORIGIN STORY (Day 1):
- Share why I started this business
- Connect my story to THEIR problem

EMAIL 3 — QUICK WIN (Day 3):
- Give them one actionable tip they can implement in under 10 minutes
- Make them experience a result before asking for anything
- Demonstrate my expertise without being preachy
- Build anticipation for the next email

EMAIL 4 — SOCIAL PROOF (Day 5):
- Share 2-3 customer success stories or testimonials
- Focus on the TRANSFORMATION, not the product features

- Soft mention of the product as the vehicle for these results

EMAIL 5 — FIRST OFFER (Day 7):
- Use the PAS framework (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
- Present my product as the logical next step
- Include a special welcome offer (discount, bonus, or bundle)
- Create urgency (48-hour window, limited quantity, bonus expiration)
- Clear, single CTA button

EMAIL 6 — OBJECTION HANDLER (Day 9):
- Address the top 3 objections my target audience has before buying: [LIST YOUR TOP 3 OBJECTIONS, e.g., "too expensive," "I don't have time," "will this work for my industry?"]
- Answer each objection with logic AND emotion
- Include a money-back guarantee or risk-reversal
- Restate the offer from Email 5

EMAIL 7 — LAST CHANCE (Day 12):
- Final reminder that the welcome offer is expiring
- Recap the value in 3 bullet points
- Add one NEW testimonial or result they haven't seen
- Scarcity + urgency + clear CTA
- Let them know what to expect going forward (regular newsletter cadence)

For EACH email, provide:
- 3 subject line options (one curiosity-based, one benefit-based, one personal/conversational)
- Preview text (40-90 characters)
- Full email body (150-300 words each — no fluff)
- CTA text and placement
- Send timing recommendation

        <div style={proTipStyle}>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> After generating your welcome sequence, send each email to yourself first and read it on your phone. Over 60% of emails are opened on mobile. If any email looks too long, has a buried CTA, or requires scrolling past a wall of text to find the point &mdash; ask AI to tighten it. The best welcome emails are 150&ndash;250 words, not 500.

- Acknowledge that they're one of your most engaged subscribers — make them feel special (not with fake flattery, but with genuine appreciation)
- Share something exclusive: an insight, a behind-the-scenes look, or early access to something you haven't announced publicly
- Use language that creates belonging: "you're one of the [X] people who..."
- No ask in this email — pure value and appreciation

EMAIL 2 — THE INSIDER (Day 3):
- Share something you normally keep behind a paywall or don't share publicly
- This could be: a strategy breakdown, a revenue number, a mistake you made, a framework, or a resource
- Position it explicitly: "I don't usually share this publicly, but since you're [VIP CRITERIA]..."
- This builds reciprocity — you gave them something valuable, they'll want to give back

EMAIL 3 — THE EXCLUSIVE OFFER (Day 7):
- Present your premium offer with a VIP-only incentive
- This should feel different from your regular promotions: different pricing, different bonus, or early access
- Reference the value you've provided in emails 1-2: "Over the past week, I've shared [X] with you because you're one of my most engaged readers. Now I want to offer you something I'm not offering anyone else."
- Make the exclusivity real — limited quantity, limited time, or VIP-only pricing
- Strong CTA with urgency

EMAIL 4 — THE INNER CIRCLE (Day 10):
- Regardless of whether they bought, invite them deeper into your ecosystem
- Options: private community, advisory board, beta testing group, referral program, or affiliate opportunity
- Frame it as a mutually beneficial relationship, not a favor
- If they DID buy, this is the upsell or community invitation
- If they DID NOT buy, this keeps the relationship warm and opens a different path to value

For each email include: subject line (3 options), preview text, full body copy (200-300 words), and CTA. Mark clearly where personalization tokens should go ([FIRST NAME], [VIP CRITERIA], etc.).`}

- Key result/transformation: [WHAT BUYERS WILL ACHIEVE]
- Social proof available: [TESTIMONIALS, BETA RESULTS, YOUR OWN RESULTS, CASE STUDIES]

Write 4 emails:

EMAIL 1 — THE TEASER (3 days before launch):
- Build anticipation without revealing the full product
- Open with the PROBLEM your audience faces (make them feel it)
- Hint at what's coming: "I've been working on something for [X MONTHS] and it's almost ready"
- Give them a reason to open the next email: "On [LAUNCH DATE], I'm releasing something that will [SPECIFIC BENEFIT]"
- Optional: early-bird waitlist link for priority access
- DO NOT reveal the price or full details yet

EMAIL 2 — THE ANNOUNCEMENT (launch day):
- This is the big reveal — lead with the transformation, not the product
- Open with a bold claim backed by a specific result: "What if you could [DESIRED OUTCOME] in [TIMEFRAME]?"
- Introduce the product: what it is, who it's for, what's included
- Stack the value: list every component with its individual value
- Present the launch offer with urgency: "[X] discount expires [DATE]" or "first [X] buyers get [BONUS]"
- Social proof: include 1-2 testimonials or results
- Clear, single CTA button: "Get [PRODUCT NAME] — $[PRICE]"
- P.S. line with urgency reminder

EMAIL 3 — THE PROOF (Day 2 of launch):
- This email is 100% social proof and results
- Open with: "I wasn't sure how people would respond. Then I opened my inbox."
- Share 3-5 testimonials, screenshots, or results from beta users/early buyers

- Final CTA with countdown language
- Genuine close: "Whether you join now or later, I appreciate you reading these emails."

          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The highest-converting product launch emails share one trait: they sell the transformation, not the product. Nobody buys a course &mdash; they buy the result the course delivers. Nobody buys software &mdash; they buy the time it saves. In every email, lead with what changes in the buyer&rsquo;s life after purchasing, not with features and specifications.

   - One that's personal/conversational

2. PREVIEW TEXT: Write 3 options (40-90 characters each)

3. EMAIL BODY (250 words max):
   - Opening hook: ONE sentence that makes them stop scrolling. Not "we're having a sale." Something that connects the product to a desire or pain point.

- Common reasons people abandon cart: [LIST 2-3, e.g., "comparing prices," "unexpected shipping costs," "not sure about sizing," "need to think about it"]

Write 3 emails:

EMAIL 1 — THE GENTLE REMINDER (sent 1 hour after abandonment):
- Tone: helpful, not salesy — "Did something go wrong?" not "BUY NOW"
- Acknowledge they left something behind without being creepy about tracking
- Show the specific product with name, image placeholder, and price
- Address the #1 abandonment reason: [MOST COMMON REASON AND YOUR RESPONSE]
- Single CTA: "Complete your order" linking directly back to their cart
- NO discount yet — many people just got distracted and will complete at full price
- Subject lines (3 options): casual, helpful, curiosity-driven

EMAIL 2 — THE VALUE REINFORCEMENT (sent 24 hours after abandonment):
- Now we add social proof and value
- Open with a testimonial from someone who bought [PRODUCT] and loved it
- Remind them what they're getting: restate the key benefits (not features) in 3 bullet points
- Address objection #2: [SECOND MOST COMMON REASON]
- Mention your guarantee/return policy to reduce risk
- Still NO discount — test this sequence without one first
- CTA: "Your [PRODUCT] is still waiting"
- Subject lines (3 options): social proof, benefit-driven, personal

EMAIL 3 — THE INCENTIVE (sent 72 hours after abandonment):
- This is where you offer the incentive (if needed): [INCENTIVE, e.g., "10% off," "free shipping," "$5 off," "free bonus item"]
- Open with: "I normally don't do this, but..."
- Make the incentive feel exclusive and earned, not desperate
- Combine: social proof + incentive + urgency + guarantee
- Set a deadline for the incentive: "This offer expires in 48 hours"
- Final CTA with discount code or auto-applied link
- If they still don't buy, mark them for a different nurture track (not more cart emails)
- Subject lines (3 options): incentive-focused, urgency, final chance

For each email: subject lines, preview text, full body copy, CTA text, and send timing. Also include: recommended A/B test for each email (one variable to test per email).`}

        <div style={proTipStyle}>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Do not lead with a discount in Email 1. Data from Klaviyo and Omnisend consistently shows that 30&ndash;40% of cart abandoners complete their purchase from a simple reminder email &mdash; no incentive needed. If you immediately offer 10% off, you train your audience to abandon carts on purpose. Save the discount for Email 3, and only for the people who genuinely needed the nudge.

2. OPENING HOOK (2-3 sentences): Start with a bold statement, a surprising statistic, or a brief story that sets up the big idea. The reader should immediately think "wait, what?" or "tell me more."

3. THE SETUP: Describe the conventional wisdom in 2-3 sentences. Show that you understand why most people believe it. This builds credibility before you challenge it.

4. THE BREAKDOWN: Present your counter-argument in 3-5 short paragraphs. Each paragraph should make ONE point, supported by evidence (data, story, or logical reasoning). Use this structure:
   - Point 1: The strongest evidence that the conventional wisdom is wrong
   - Point 2: What you've seen/done differently and the results
   - Point 3: The framework or mental model you use instead

5. THE TAKEAWAY: 2-3 sentences that tell readers exactly what to do with this information. Be specific and prescriptive. Not "think differently about X" but "this week, try [SPECIFIC ACTION]."

6. THE CLOSE: End with a question that invites healthy debate in the replies. Great thought leadership emails generate responses.

Target length: 500-700 words. Write it so it could be screenshot-shared on social media. Every paragraph should be strong enough to stand alone.`}

        <p>Cold email has a bad reputation because most cold emails are terrible. They are generic, self-centered, and read like spam. But done right, cold email is one of the most effective growth channels for B2B companies, agencies, consultants, and anyone selling high-ticket services. The average cold email gets a 1&ndash;5% reply rate. The prompts below are designed to hit 10&ndash;20%+ by being specific, relevant, and human.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>13. The Cold Email Introduction</h3>
        <p>The first cold email is everything. You have 2&ndash;3 seconds to earn their attention before they delete, archive, or mark you as spam. This prompt creates cold emails that feel like they were written specifically for the recipient &mdash; because the prompt ensures they are.</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Write a cold outreach email to a potential [CLIENT/CUSTOMER/PARTNER].

About my business:
- What I sell: [SERVICE/PRODUCT, e.g., "SEO services for e-commerce brands," "custom software development," "executive coaching"]
- My ideal client: [WHO, e.g., "DTC e-commerce brands doing $1M-$10M revenue," "Series A SaaS companies," "C-suite executives at mid-market companies"]
- My key differentiator: [WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT, e.g., "we guarantee page-1 rankings or your money back," "we only work with 5 clients at a time," "I've coached 200+ executives at Fortune 500 companies"]
- Price range: [APPROXIMATE PRICE RANGE]
- Best result I've delivered: [YOUR MOST IMPRESSIVE CLIENT RESULT WITH SPECIFICS]

About the prospect:
- Name: [PROSPECT NAME]
- Title: [THEIR TITLE]
- Company: [THEIR COMPANY]
- Company size: [APPROXIMATE SIZE]
- What their company does: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
- Something specific about them: [A DETAIL FROM THEIR WEBSITE, LINKEDIN, RECENT NEWS, PODCAST APPEARANCE, OR SOCIAL MEDIA POST]
- Their likely pain point: [YOUR EDUCATED GUESS ABOUT WHAT THEY STRUGGLE WITH]

Write the cold email:

1. SUBJECT LINE: 5 options. Rules for cold email subjects:
   - No clickbait — they'll hate you forever
   - Lowercase works better than Title Case
   - Reference them or their company, not yourself
   - Under 6 words performs best
   - Example formats: "quick question about [TOPIC]", "[THEIR COMPANY] + [YOUR COMPANY]", "idea for [THEIR SPECIFIC CHALLENGE]"

2. EMAIL BODY (under 125 words — hard limit):
   - Line 1: Personalized opener referencing [SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THEM]. Not "I hope this email finds you well." Something that proves you actually researched them. One sentence.
   - Line 2-3: The value statement. Connect YOUR capability to THEIR specific situation. "I noticed [THEIR SITUATION/PAIN POINT]. We helped [SIMILAR COMPANY] achieve [SPECIFIC RESULT]."
   - Line 4: The ask. One clear, low-commitment CTA. Not "let's jump on a call." Something easy: "Would it be worth a 15-minute chat to see if this could work for [THEIR COMPANY]?" or "Want me to send over a quick analysis?"
   - Sign-off: First name only. Keep it casual.

3. FORMATTING RULES:
   - No bold, no bullet points, no HTML — plain text only
   - No attachments or images
   - No "sent from my iPhone" fake casual
   - No long signature block — just name, title, one link
   - Write at an 8th-grade reading level
   - Must pass the "would I respond to this?" test

Do NOT write anything that sounds like a mass email. This should read like a one-to-one message from a real person.`}

          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The number-one predictor of cold email success is relevance, not cleverness. A simple, direct email that demonstrates you understand the prospect&rsquo;s specific situation will outperform a witty, creative email that could have been sent to anyone. Spend 80% of your time on research and 20% on writing.

        <p>Partnerships &mdash; co-marketing, affiliate deals, joint ventures, integration partnerships &mdash; can 10x your reach overnight. But most partnership pitches fail because they focus on what YOU want instead of what the PARTNER gets. This prompt flips the script.</p>

- Company name: [YOUR COMPANY]
- What I do: [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]
- My audience size: [YOUR REACH, e.g., "25K email subscribers," "100K monthly site visitors," "50K social media followers"]
- My audience demographics: [WHO MY AUDIENCE IS]

The potential partner:
- Company name: [PARTNER COMPANY]
- What they do: [THEIR PRODUCT/SERVICE]
- Their audience: [WHO THEIR AUDIENCE IS — must overlap with yours]
- Contact name and title: [NAME AND TITLE]
- Why they'd be a good partner: [THE OVERLAP OR SYNERGY, e.g., "their audience needs my product but they don't offer it," "we serve the same audience with complementary products"]

Partnership proposal:
- Type of partnership: [WHAT I'M PROPOSING, e.g., "co-hosted webinar," "cross-promotion to each other's email lists," "affiliate/revenue share," "product integration," "guest content swap," "bundle deal"]
- What I bring to the table: [SPECIFIC VALUE FOR THEM, e.g., "exposure to my 25K subscribers," "20% revenue share on every referral," "content creation for their blog"]
- What I want from them: [SPECIFIC ASK, e.g., "promotion to their list," "product integration," "co-branded campaign"]
- Proof this works: [EXAMPLE OF A SIMILAR PARTNERSHIP THAT SUCCEEDED, or a specific reason why this would benefit them]

Write the email:

1. SUBJECT LINE: 5 options. Partnership subjects work best when they're specific and benefit-focused: "collab idea: [YOUR COMPANY] x [THEIR COMPANY]" or "quick idea to get [THEIR COMPANY] in front of [X] [AUDIENCE TYPE]"

2. EMAIL BODY (under 200 words):
   - Opening: Lead with a genuine compliment about their work (specific, not generic)
   - The overlap: Explain WHY your audiences are complementary in one sentence
   - The proposal: State what you're proposing clearly and concisely
   - What's in it for THEM: Lead with their benefits, not yours. Be specific with numbers: "This would put [THEIR COMPANY] in front of [X] [AUDIENCE TYPE] who already [RELEVANT BEHAVIOR]"
   - Social proof: Mention a similar partnership that worked, or your relevant metrics
   - The ask: Low-commitment next step — "Would you be open to a quick call to explore this?"

3. IMPORTANT: The email should be 80% about THEM and their benefit, 20% about you. Most partnership pitches fail because they're self-centered.`}

        <p>80% of deals require at least 5 follow-ups, but 44% of salespeople give up after one email. The follow-up is where the money is. This prompt creates a 4-email follow-up sequence that stays persistent without being annoying &mdash; each email adds new value instead of just &ldquo;checking in.&rdquo;</p>

Context:
- The original cold email pitched: [WHAT YOU OFFERED]
- The prospect: [THEIR NAME, TITLE, AND COMPANY]
- Their likely pain point: [PAIN POINT YOU ADDRESSED]
- Your best result: [YOUR MOST IMPRESSIVE RELEVANT RESULT]

Write 4 follow-ups, each adding NEW value (never just "circling back" or "checking in"):

FOLLOW-UP 1 (3 days after original email):
- Subject: Reply to the original thread (no new subject line)
- Strategy: Share a relevant insight, tip, or resource related to their pain point
- Format: "Hi [NAME], thought you might find this useful — [BRIEF INSIGHT OR LINK TO ARTICLE/CASE STUDY]. It's related to [THE THING YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR FIRST EMAIL]. Worth a quick look. — [YOUR NAME]"
- Under 50 words. No ask. Pure value.

FOLLOW-UP 2 (7 days after original email):
- Subject: Reply to same thread
- Strategy: Share a specific, relevant case study or result
- Format: "Hi [NAME], quick update — we just helped [SIMILAR COMPANY IN THEIR INDUSTRY] achieve [SPECIFIC RESULT]. Their situation was similar to what I see at [PROSPECT'S COMPANY]. Happy to share the details if you're curious. — [YOUR NAME]"
- Under 75 words. Soft ask.

FOLLOW-UP 3 (14 days after original email):
- Subject: Reply to same thread
- Strategy: The "new angle" — approach the value proposition from a different direction
- Instead of repeating the original pitch, highlight a DIFFERENT benefit or use case
- Include a question: "Is [PAIN POINT] still a priority for [THEIR COMPANY] this quarter?"
- Under 75 words. Direct question CTA.

FOLLOW-UP 4 (21 days after original email):
- Subject: Reply to same thread
- Strategy: The permission-based close
- Format: "Hi [NAME], I've reached out a few times about [TOPIC]. I don't want to be a pest. If the timing isn't right, no worries at all — just let me know and I'll stop reaching out. But if [PAIN POINT] is still on your radar, I'd love 15 minutes to show you how we've helped companies like [SIMILAR COMPANY] solve it. Either way, all good. — [YOUR NAME]"
- Under 75 words. Gives them an easy out, which paradoxically increases response rates.

Rules for ALL follow-ups:
- Always reply to the original thread (don't start new threads)
- Never use: "just checking in," "circling back," "touching base," "bumping this to the top"
- Each email must add something new (insight, data, case study, question)
- Keep every email under 75 words
- Plain text, no formatting
- Sound like a human, not a sequence`}

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>16. The Breakup Email</h3>
        <p>The breakup email is the final email in a cold outreach sequence. Counterintuitively, it often gets the highest reply rate of any email in the sequence because it uses loss aversion: people respond to the idea that they are about to lose access to something. It also gives the prospect an easy, guilt-free way to say &ldquo;not now&rdquo; instead of ignoring you.</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Write a "breakup email" — the final email in a cold outreach sequence where I give the prospect an easy out.

Context:
- Prospect: [NAME AND COMPANY]
- What I've been pitching: [YOUR OFFER IN ONE SENTENCE]
- Number of previous emails sent (with no reply): [NUMBER, e.g., "4"]
- The core value I offer: [THE MAIN BENEFIT, e.g., "we help e-commerce brands increase email revenue by 40%+"]

Write the breakup email:

1. SUBJECT LINE: 5 options. Breakup subjects work best when they're short and slightly surprising:
   - "should I close your file?"
   - "not a fit?"
   - "one last thing"
   - "going to stop reaching out"
   - "[NAME], permission to close the loop?"

2. EMAIL BODY (under 100 words):
   Structure:
   - Acknowledge you've reached out several times with no response (no guilt-tripping)
   - Offer two options: (A) "If [PAIN POINT] isn't a priority right now, totally understand — just reply 'pass' and I'll stop emailing" or (B) "If timing is just off, let me know when to check back and I'll set a reminder"
   - One final value statement: "Either way, we've helped [SIMILAR COMPANY] [SPECIFIC RESULT], and the door's always open."
   - Close: "No hard feelings either way. — [FIRST NAME]"

3. WHY THIS WORKS: Include a brief note (2-3 sentences) explaining the psychology behind breakup emails that I can reference when my team asks why we send this.

The tone should be confident, respectful, and genuinely okay with either outcome. Never passive-aggressive. Never guilt-inducing. The prospect should feel respected, not pressured.`}
        </div>

        <div style={proTipStyle}>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Breakup emails consistently get 2&ndash;3x the reply rate of other follow-up emails. The reason is simple: loss aversion. When someone realizes they are about to lose access to you (even if they were ignoring you), a part of their brain re-evaluates. Many prospects reply to breakup emails with &ldquo;sorry for the delay, let&rsquo;s chat next week&rdquo; &mdash; which is exactly what you want.

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>17. The Re-Engagement Campaign</h3>
        <p>Every email list has a segment of &ldquo;cold&rdquo; subscribers who stopped opening emails. They are dead weight that hurts your deliverability &mdash; or they are untapped revenue waiting to be reactivated. This prompt creates a re-engagement sequence to find out which is which.</p>

- Total inactive subscribers: [APPROXIMATE NUMBER]
- What I want them to do: [GOAL, e.g., "start opening emails again," "click through to my site," "make a purchase"]

Write 3 emails:

EMAIL 1 — THE CHECK-IN (Day 0):
- Subject line options (5): Mix of curiosity, direct, and personal. Examples that work: "still interested in [TOPIC]?", "[FIRST NAME], it's been a while", "should I keep sending these?"
- Tone: Warm, not desperate. Like checking in with a friend you haven't heard from, not begging for attention.
- Acknowledge the gap: "I noticed you haven't opened my emails recently" — be upfront
- Remind them why they subscribed: "You joined because [ORIGINAL VALUE PROPOSITION]"
- Give them a reason to re-engage: share your BEST recent content, resource, or offer in one sentence
- CTA: "Click here to stay on the list" (this click confirms engagement and moves them out of the inactive segment)
- Alternative CTA: "If you'd prefer to unsubscribe, no hard feelings — click here"
- Giving them an unsubscribe option paradoxically increases engagement because it shows confidence

EMAIL 2 — THE VALUE BOMB (Day 3, only if they didn't engage with Email 1):
- Subject line options (5): Lead with pure value. "I made something for you" or "free [RESOURCE] — just for subscribers"
- Give them something genuinely valuable for free: [DESCRIBE THE VALUE, e.g., "exclusive discount," "free resource/template," "early access to new content"]
- Do not ask for anything in return except a click
- Keep it short: under 100 words
- CTA: Download/access the free resource (the click re-engages them)

EMAIL 3 — THE GOODBYE (Day 7, only if they didn't engage with Email 1 or 2):
- Subject line options (3): "goodbye?", "I'm cleaning up my list", "[FIRST NAME], last email from me"
- Be direct: "I'm going to remove you from my list unless you want to stay"
- Remind them ONE more time what they'll miss: your best content, exclusive offers, or community
- Two clear CTAs: "Keep me subscribed" (prominent) and "Unsubscribe" (secondary)
- Set a deadline: "If I don't hear from you in 48 hours, I'll remove you to keep my list healthy"
- Tone: Respectful and matter-of-fact. Not guilt-tripping.

POST-SEQUENCE:
- If they engaged with ANY email: move them back to the active segment
- If they didn't engage with any email: remove them from the list (include a note about why list hygiene matters for deliverability)

For each email: subject lines, preview text, full body, CTA text.`}

        <div style={proTipStyle}>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Do not be afraid to remove subscribers who do not engage. A smaller, engaged list will always outperform a large, dead one. Inactive subscribers hurt your sender reputation, which means your emails to ACTIVE subscribers are more likely to land in spam. Clean your list quarterly and your open rates will climb.

- What makes customers stay: [TOP 3 REASONS CUSTOMERS GIVE FOR STAYING, e.g., "time savings," "the community," "customer support quality"]
- What makes customers leave: [TOP 3 REASONS CUSTOMERS GIVE FOR CHURNING, e.g., "not using it enough," "too expensive," "found an alternative"]

   - "I have an idea for you"

2. EMAIL BODY (under 200 words):

   - Remind them of a specific feature or use case they may not be using: "A lot of our customers in [THEIR INDUSTRY/ROLE] love [SPECIFIC FEATURE] for [SPECIFIC USE CASE]. Have you tried it?"
   - Share a quick win they can get in under 5 minutes: "Here's one thing you can do right now that most [PRODUCT] users find valuable: [SPECIFIC ACTION + LINK]"
   - Offer help: "If something's not working the way you expected, I'd love to hear about it. Reply to this email or [BOOK A CALL LINK]."

3. FOLLOW-UP (if no response after 5 days):
   - Shorter email (under 100 words)
   - Offer a tangible incentive to re-engage: [INCENTIVE, e.g., "free month," "1-on-1 onboarding call," "feature upgrade," "extended trial of premium features"]
   - Create soft urgency: "This offer is available for the next 7 days"
   - CTA: Accept the offer or schedule a call

4. IF THEY STILL DON'T ENGAGE: Include a note about when to send a cancellation survey vs. when to let them be.

- Incentive (optional): [e.g., "10% off next order," "entry into a gift card drawing," "free bonus resource," "no incentive — relying on goodwill"]

   - "your opinion matters, [FIRST NAME]"
   - "one question for you"
   - "help me make [PRODUCT] better"
   - "I need your honest feedback"

2. EMAIL BODY (under 150 words):
   - Opening: Thank them for being a customer. One genuine sentence, not a paragraph.
   - The ask: Be crystal clear about what you want and how long it takes: "I have [ONE QUESTION / A 2-MINUTE SURVEY / 3 QUICK QUESTIONS]. Your answer helps me [SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENT]."
   - Make it EASY: The absolute lowest friction path to providing feedback:
     - Option A: Reply directly to this email with your answer (best for open-ended)
     - Option B: Click a button (1-5 rating scale embedded in the email)
     - Option C: Link to a short survey (max 3-5 questions)
   - If offering incentive: Mention it after the ask, not before (it should feel like a thank-you, not a bribe)
   - Close: "Even a one-line reply helps. Thank you. — [YOUR NAME]"

   - Write 3 versions: a one-question version, a three-question version, and a five-question survey version
   - Each question should give me information I can actually act on (not "how was your experience?" but "what's the ONE thing you'd change about [PRODUCT]?")

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>How to Get the Best Results from These Prompts</h2>

        <p>Every prompt in this guide works out of the box. But if you want to go from &ldquo;good&rdquo; to &ldquo;incredible,&rdquo; here are the techniques that separate average AI email marketers from great ones:</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Always Include Your Brand Voice</h3>
        <p>Add a line like: &ldquo;Write in a [casual/professional/bold/empathetic] tone. Use [contractions/short sentences/humor/data]. Avoid [corporate jargon/emojis/exclamation marks].&rdquo; Better yet, paste a sample of an email you wrote that performed well and say &ldquo;match this voice.&rdquo; The AI will mirror your style.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Feed It Your Data</h3>
        <p>The more specific your inputs, the more specific the outputs. Instead of &ldquo;my audience is marketers,&rdquo; say &ldquo;my audience is B2B SaaS marketing managers at companies with 50&ndash;200 employees who are frustrated with their current email platform&rsquo;s deliverability.&rdquo; Specificity is the single biggest lever for AI output quality.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Iterate, Do Not Settle</h3>
        <p>Your first output is a draft, not a final product. After generating an email, say: &ldquo;Make the opening hook more surprising,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The CTA is weak &mdash; rewrite it with more urgency,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This sounds too formal &mdash; make it sound like a text message from a friend.&rdquo; Two rounds of iteration typically gets you to 90% quality.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Test Everything</h3>
        <p>AI makes A/B testing easy because generating variations is free. For every email, generate 3&ndash;5 subject lines and test them. Generate 2 versions of the body copy with different frameworks (PAS vs. AIDA) and test them. Over time, you will learn which frameworks and styles work best for YOUR specific audience, and you can bake those learnings back into your prompts.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Build a Prompt Library</h3>
        <p>After you find prompts that work, save them with your brand voice, audience details, and product information already filled in. This turns a 10-minute prompting session into a 2-minute one. The <Link href="/email-marketing-kit" style={{ color: '#3B5FFF' }}>AI Email Marketing Kit</Link> does this for you with 150+ pre-built, framework-backed prompts organized by email type.</p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Can AI write effective marketing emails?</h3>
        <p>Yes, when you give it the right prompts. The difference between a useless AI email and a high-converting one is the framework you provide. Generic prompts produce generic copy. The prompts in this guide include specific copywriting frameworks &mdash; PAS, AIDA, curiosity gaps, social proof stacking &mdash; that consistently produce emails with above-average open and click-through rates. You still need to provide your brand voice, product details, and audience specifics, but AI handles the structure, psychology, and first-draft copywriting.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>What is the best AI tool for email marketing in 2026?</h3>
        <p>ChatGPT (GPT-4o) and Claude are both excellent for writing marketing emails. ChatGPT handles structured sequences and A/B variations well. Claude produces more natural, conversational copy. For email-specific tools, Jasper and Copy.ai have built-in templates, but general-purpose AI with good prompts gives you more control and flexibility. Every prompt in this guide works with any AI tool. Use a paid tier to avoid usage limits during campaign creation sprints.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>How do I avoid my AI-written emails sounding robotic?</h3>
        <p>Include your brand voice guidelines directly in the prompt: specify tone, reading level, and whether you use contractions, humor, or emojis. Paste examples of emails you have written that performed well and ask AI to match that style. Always include a &ldquo;write like a real person&rdquo; instruction. Then edit the output &mdash; use AI for the first draft and add your personal touches. Read it aloud. If it sounds like something you would never say, rewrite that section.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>How many emails should be in a welcome sequence?</h3>
        <p>A strong welcome sequence is 5&ndash;7 emails sent over 10&ndash;14 days. The structure: deliver the lead magnet (immediate), share your origin story (Day 1&ndash;2), provide a quick win (Day 3&ndash;4), share social proof (Day 5&ndash;7), introduce your product (Day 7&ndash;9), handle objections (Day 10&ndash;12), and make your best offer with urgency (Day 13&ndash;14). Prompt #1 in this guide creates all 7 emails in one session, with each building on the last to move subscribers from awareness to purchase.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>What email metrics should I track to measure AI prompt effectiveness?</h3>
        <p>Five metrics matter: (1) Open rate &mdash; 20&ndash;25% benchmark, driven by subject lines. (2) Click-through rate &mdash; 2&ndash;5% benchmark, driven by body copy and CTA placement. (3) Conversion rate &mdash; percentage of clickers who take the desired action. (4) Unsubscribe rate &mdash; keep below 0.5% per send. (5) Revenue per email &mdash; the ultimate metric. When A/B testing AI-generated variations, send to at least 1,000 subscribers per variant for statistically significant results. Test one variable at a time.</p>
