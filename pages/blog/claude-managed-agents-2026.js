          Anthropic Just Launched Claude Managed Agents — What It Means for Your Business
        </h1>
        <p style={{ color: 'var(--text-secondary)', fontSize: '14px', marginBottom: '40px' }}>Apr 9, 2026 &middot; Rey Midas &middot; 10 min read</p>

        <p>Anthropic just dropped <strong>Claude Managed Agents</strong> in public beta — and this is not another incremental model update. This is infrastructure. A full platform for building, deploying, and running cloud-hosted AI agents that operate autonomously for hours, survive disconnections, and coordinate with each other to complete complex work.</p>

        <p>Notion, Rakuten, Asana, Vibecode, and Sentry are already building on it. They are not running experiments. They are shipping production agents that debug code, manage projects, and handle enterprise workflows across entire departments.</p>

        <p>If you have been watching the AI agent space from the sidelines, this is the moment the sidelines disappear. Here is what the platform does, who is using it, and what it means for your team.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid var(--border)' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>What Claude Managed Agents Actually Does</h2>

        <p>Until now, building an AI agent that runs reliably in production was brutal. You had to handle state management, authentication, sandboxing, crash recovery, and execution tracing yourself. Most teams gave up or shipped fragile prototypes that broke every few hours.</p>

        <p>Anthropic's Managed Agents platform solves the hard infrastructure problems so teams can focus on what their agents actually do:</p>

        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '24px' }}>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Cloud-hosted execution</strong> — Agents run on Anthropic's infrastructure, not your laptop. Close your browser, they keep working.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Secure sandboxed code execution</strong> — Agents can write and run code in isolated environments without risking your production systems.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Checkpointing and state management</strong> — If an agent crashes or a network blip happens, it picks up exactly where it left off. No lost work.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Credential management and authentication</strong> — Agents can securely access APIs, databases, and third-party services with proper auth — no hardcoded keys.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Scoped permissions and identity management</strong> — You define exactly what each agent can and cannot do. Least-privilege by design.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>End-to-end execution tracing</strong> — Full visibility into every step the agent takes. Debugging and auditing built in from the start.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Long-running sessions</strong> — These agents run for hours, not minutes. Complex research, multi-step workflows, deep analysis — all in a single session.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Multi-agent coordination</strong> (research preview) — Multiple agents can work together, splitting tasks and sharing context. This is where it gets really interesting.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Self-evaluation</strong> — Agents assess their own output and iterate toward defined outcomes instead of blindly executing and hoping for the best.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The composable API design means you can build agents that fit your exact workflow — not shoehorn your processes into someone else's template.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid var(--border)' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Who Is Already Using It</h2>

        <p>This is not vaporware. Real companies are already in production or late-stage deployment with Claude Managed Agents. Here is what they are building:</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Notion</h3>
        <p>Notion is building custom agents for coding and knowledge work that run inside their platform. The key detail: <strong>parallel task execution</strong>. Multiple agents working on different parts of a project simultaneously, not sequentially. This is what turns a 4-hour research task into a 30-minute one.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Rakuten</h3>
        <p>Rakuten is deploying enterprise agents across product, sales, marketing, and finance — integrated directly with Slack and Microsoft Teams. The number that matters: <strong>one-week deployment cycles</strong>. They are spinning up new department-specific agents in days, not quarters. That is the speed advantage of building on managed infrastructure versus rolling your own.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Asana</h3>
        <p>Asana is building "AI Teammates" — agents that join your projects, take on tasks, and draft deliverables. Not summarizing your project. Actually doing the work within your existing project management workflow. This is the first serious example of AI agents integrated into a tool that millions of teams already use daily.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Vibecode</h3>
        <p>Vibecode reports <strong>10x faster deployment</strong> for AI-native applications. When your infrastructure handles the hard parts — sandboxing, state, auth, tracing — you ship agents at the speed of writing prompts, not the speed of writing infrastructure code.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Sentry</h3>
        <p>This is the one that should make every engineering team pay attention. Sentry is building agents that <strong>debug issues, write patches, and open pull requests</strong> — and they shipped this in weeks, not months. The agent reads the error, traces the root cause, writes the fix, tests it, and opens the PR. A human reviews and merges. That is the new workflow.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid var(--border)' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>The Bigger Picture — Why This Matters Right Now</h2>

        <p>Zoom out for a second and connect the dots:</p>

        <p><strong>Ramp</strong> built an internal tool called "Glass" — essentially their own version of Claude Cowork — and hit <strong>99.5% AI adoption</strong> across the entire company. Not 99.5% of the engineering team. The entire company. Finance, legal, ops, everyone. (<Link href="/blog/ramp-ai-adoption-playbook-2026" style={{ color: 'var(--accent)' }}>We broke down their playbook here.</Link>)</p>

        <p>Now <strong>Anthropic</strong> is launching managed agents as infrastructure — giving every company the building blocks to create their own Glass, their own AI Teammates, their own autonomous debugging pipeline.</p>

        <p>And <strong>Felix Craft</strong> — an autonomous AI agent — crossed <strong>$300K per month</strong> in revenue, running 24/7 without a team. (<Link href="/blog/ai-agent-10k-day" style={{ color: 'var(--accent)' }}>We covered the architecture behind it.</Link>)</p>

        <p>The pattern is unmistakable:</p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '24px' }}>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '8px' }}>AI agents are no longer experiments. They are production infrastructure.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '8px' }}>The companies adopting them are not doing it cautiously. They are going all in, across every department.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '8px' }}>The deployment speed is accelerating. What took 6 months a year ago now takes weeks.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '8px' }}>The revenue potential is proven — both for companies using agents internally and agents operating autonomously.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is the inflection point. Anthropic building managed infrastructure means the barrier to entry just dropped from "hire an AI engineering team" to "have a developer who can call an API." The gap between AI-adopting companies and AI-ignoring companies is about to widen dramatically.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid var(--border)' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>What This Means for Your Team — 3 Levels of AI Agent Adoption</h2>

        <p>Not every team needs to build custom managed agents on day one. But every team needs to be moving up this ladder, because your competitors are.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Level 1: Individual Productivity</h3>
        <p>This is where most teams should start. Tools like Claude Cowork and Claude Code running on individual machines, helping each person work faster. Not replacing anyone — amplifying everyone. Writing better emails, drafting documents, analyzing data, debugging code, researching competitors.</p>
        <p>The biggest mistake here is letting people figure it out alone. Without structured skills and workflows, most people try Claude twice, get a mediocre result, and go back to doing everything manually.</p>

        </div>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Level 2: Team-Wide AI Adoption</h3>
        <p>This is where the compounding happens. Instead of individual experimentation, you roll out AI systematically: shared skill libraries, department-specific playbooks, adoption tracking, and a common language for how your team works with AI.</p>
        <p>Ramp did not hit 99.5% adoption by sending a Slack message saying "try Claude." They built infrastructure, tracked usage, created templates, and made AI the default for every workflow. Your team can do the same.</p>

        <div style={{ margin: '24px 0', padding: '20px', background: 'var(--surface)', border: '1px solid var(--border)', borderRadius: '8px' }}>
          <p style={{ margin: '0 0 12px', fontWeight: '600', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif' }}>AI Team Adoption Kit — $49</p>

        </div>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Level 3: Custom Managed Agents</h3>
        <p>This is what Anthropic just made possible at scale. Custom agents that run in the cloud, handle complex multi-step workflows, and operate autonomously. The Sentry agent that debugs and patches code. The Rakuten agents that handle cross-department workflows. The Notion agents that parallelize research.</p>
        <p>But here is the critical insight most teams miss: <strong>you cannot jump to Level 3 without mastering Levels 1 and 2.</strong></p>
        <p>If your team has not built the muscle of working with AI daily — if they do not have shared skills, tested workflows, and a culture of AI-first problem solving — throwing custom managed agents at them will fail. The agents will be poorly scoped, the prompts will be mediocre, and nobody will trust the output enough to act on it.</p>
        <p>Ramp did not start with autonomous agents. They started with individual tools, built adoption, created shared infrastructure, and then expanded. That sequence matters.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid var(--border)' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>What to Do This Week</h2>

        <p>You do not need to sign up for Anthropic's managed agents platform today. But you do need to start moving:</p>

        <ol style={{ paddingLeft: '24px' }}>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Get your individual AI workflow locked in.</strong> If you are not using Claude Cowork or Claude Code daily, you are already behind. Start with structured skills, not blank prompts.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Pick one team and roll out AI systematically.</strong> Not "everyone try this." A real rollout with playbooks, tracking, and shared skills. One department, 30 days, measurable outcomes.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '12px' }}><strong>Watch the managed agents space.</strong> Anthropic is in public beta. The multi-agent coordination feature is in research preview. The window between "early adopter advantage" and "table stakes" is shrinking fast.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The companies shipping agents today — Notion, Sentry, Rakuten — did not start last week. They started building their AI adoption foundation months ago. The best time to start was then. The second best time is now.</p>
