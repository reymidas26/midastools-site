          text: 'Yes, ChatGPT can generate images on the free tier using DALL-E, but with daily limits. Free users typically get a small number of image generations per day. ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) and Pro ($200/month) users get significantly higher limits. For most people doing serious image work, the Plus plan is worth it for the increased generation allowance and faster processing times.'

          '@type': 'Answer',
          text: 'The best ChatGPT image prompts follow a specific structure: start with the subject, then describe the style or medium (photography, illustration, 3D render), add lighting details (soft natural light, dramatic studio lighting), specify the composition (close-up, wide angle, bird\'s eye view), and include mood or atmosphere keywords. Being specific about what you want produces dramatically better results than vague descriptions. Include details about colors, textures, and background elements for the most control over the output.'

You can use them for social media, marketing materials, products, and more. However, you should be aware of potential issues: do not generate images of real people without consent, avoid creating images that closely mimic copyrighted characters or styles of living artists, and always disclose AI-generated content when required by platform policies or regulations.'

          text: 'In 2026, ChatGPT excels at photorealistic portraits and product photography, Studio Ghibli and anime-style illustrations, cinematic movie poster compositions, flat lay and lifestyle product shots, minimalist brand graphics, and retro or nostalgic aesthetics. The model handles realistic lighting and textures particularly well. For best results, reference specific photography or art styles in your prompt rather than describing the look from scratch.'

          text: 'To get consistent results across multiple image generations, create a "style anchor" — a set of parameters you reuse in every prompt. Include the same camera type, lighting setup, color palette, and art style keywords. For example, always starting with "professional product photography, Canon EOS R5, 85mm lens, soft diffused natural light, white marble surface" will give you a cohesive set of images. Save your best-performing prompts as templates and modify only the subject while keeping the style parameters identical.'

        <p>ChatGPT image generation went from a novelty to a cultural phenomenon in 2026. People are creating Studio Ghibli portraits, hyper-realistic product mockups, viral meme templates, and professional brand visuals &mdash; all from a text prompt.</p>
        <p>The problem? Most people type &ldquo;a cat sitting on a chair&rdquo; and wonder why the output looks mediocre. Meanwhile, creators who know how to write specific, detailed prompts are generating images that rack up millions of views, replace expensive photoshoots, and sell products.</p>
        <p>These are not theoretical prompts. These are the <strong>50 prompts people are actually using</strong> to create viral images right now. Every single one is copy-paste ready. I have organized them by use case so you can jump straight to the category you need.</p>
        <p>Paste any of these into ChatGPT (Plus or Pro for best results) and watch what happens.</p>

        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`A split-screen comparison image divided cleanly down the middle.

Right side labeled "REALITY": [describe the messy, chaotic, funny version — e.g., the same desk but covered in crumbs, tangled cables, a half-eaten sandwich, a cat sitting on the keyboard, coffee stain on papers, sticky notes everywhere]. Both sides should be photographed in the same style and angle so the comparison is immediate. Warm, realistic lighting in both. The humor comes from recognition, not exaggeration.`}

Bright, saturated colors: electric blues, hot pinks, deep oranges. Hand-painted typography for the title in a bold, metallic-effect chrome or gold font. A tagline in italic: "[YOUR TAGLINE]".

- A miniature construction crew working on a half-eaten sandwich
- Tiny surfers riding the curved edge of a coffee cup
- Miniature office workers having a meeting on a computer keyboard

The tiny people are hyper-detailed with realistic clothing and shadows. The everyday object is shot in extreme macro, showing its texture at massive scale. Tilt-shift depth of field with only the tiny figures in sharp focus. Natural lighting as if the scene is on a desk near a window. The image should make you do a double-take — is it real or miniature?

Direction B (Illustrated): A bold, graphic illustration in the style of [a Japanese woodblock print / a Basquiat painting / a minimal line drawing / a psychedelic 70s poster]. Limited color palette: [3-4 colors]. The art is striking and would look iconic at small sizes on Spotify.

Direction C (Abstract): A pure abstract composition — [flowing paint pours / cracked and peeling textures / geometric shapes / light leaks and color bleed]. No recognizable objects. The texture and color create a mood that matches [describe the feeling of the music]. Album title barely visible, integrated into the texture.`}

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>5 Pro Tips for Better AI Image Results</h2>
        <p>You now have 50 prompts, but the people who get truly exceptional results understand a few principles that apply to every single prompt.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 1: Specify the Camera and Lens</h3>
        <p>For photorealistic images, always include a camera body and lens in your prompt. &ldquo;Shot on a Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4&rdquo; produces dramatically different (and better) results than just describing a scene. The model understands how different lenses compress perspective, control depth of field, and render bokeh. A 24mm wide angle feels expansive and environmental. An 85mm feels intimate and flattering. A 200mm telephoto feels compressed and voyeuristic. Use this to your advantage.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 2: Describe the Lighting, Not Just the Subject</h3>
        <p>Lighting is what separates amateur images from professional ones &mdash; in real photography and in AI generation. Instead of just describing what is in the image, describe <strong>how it is lit</strong>. &ldquo;Soft diffused natural light from a large window on the left&rdquo; is infinitely more useful than &ldquo;well-lit.&rdquo; Learn a few lighting terms: Rembrandt lighting, split lighting, butterfly lighting, rim light, backlighting, golden hour, overcast diffused. Each one produces a completely different mood.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 3: Reference Real Artists, Films, or Magazines</h3>
        <p>The fastest way to communicate a style is to reference something specific. &ldquo;In the style of Wes Anderson&rdquo; communicates more in five words than a paragraph of description. &ldquo;Shot for National Geographic,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vogue editorial quality,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pixar rendering style&rdquo; &mdash; these references activate specific aesthetic patterns that produce far more cohesive results than trying to describe a style from scratch.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 4: Include Negative Instructions</h3>
        <p>Tell the AI what you <strong>do not</strong> want. &ldquo;No text in the image,&rdquo; &ldquo;no watermarks,&rdquo; &ldquo;no overly saturated colors,&rdquo; &ldquo;no people in the background,&rdquo; &ldquo;no digital sharpening artifacts.&rdquo; Negative instructions prevent the most common problems before they happen. This is especially useful for avoiding the &ldquo;AI look&rdquo; &mdash; that overly smooth, hyper-saturated aesthetic that screams artificial.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 5: Iterate, Do Not Regenerate</h3>
        <p>When you get a result that is 70% right, do not start over. Tell ChatGPT what to change: &ldquo;Same image but make the lighting warmer,&rdquo; &ldquo;zoom in closer on the face,&rdquo; &ldquo;remove the background element on the right,&rdquo; &ldquo;make the color palette more muted.&rdquo; Iterating on a good result is faster and more predictable than regenerating from scratch. Treat it like directing a photographer: give specific feedback on what to adjust.</p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Can ChatGPT generate images for free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, ChatGPT can generate images on the free tier using DALL-E, but with daily limits. Free users typically get a small number of generations per day. ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) and Pro ($200/month) users get significantly higher limits. For anyone doing serious image work &mdash; product photography, brand assets, content creation &mdash; the Plus plan is worth it for the increased generation allowance and faster processing.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>What is the best way to write ChatGPT image prompts?</h3>
        <p>Follow this structure: <strong>subject</strong> first, then <strong>style/medium</strong> (photography, illustration, 3D render), then <strong>lighting</strong> (soft natural, dramatic studio), then <strong>composition</strong> (close-up, wide angle, overhead), and finally <strong>mood/atmosphere</strong>. Be specific about colors, textures, and background elements. Include camera and lens details for photorealistic shots. The more specific your prompt, the less you need to regenerate.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Can I use ChatGPT-generated images commercially?</h3>
        <p>Yes. OpenAI grants users full rights to images created with DALL-E through ChatGPT, including commercial use. You can use them for social media, marketing, products, and more. Avoid generating images of real people without consent, do not closely mimic copyrighted characters or styles of living artists, and disclose AI-generated content when required by platform policies.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>What image styles work best with ChatGPT in 2026?</h3>
        <p>ChatGPT excels at photorealistic portraits and product photography, Studio Ghibli and anime-style illustrations, cinematic compositions, flat lay product shots, minimalist brand graphics, and retro aesthetics. The model handles realistic lighting and textures particularly well. For best results, reference specific photography or art styles rather than describing the look from scratch.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>How do I make my image prompts more consistent?</h3>
        <p>Create a &ldquo;style anchor&rdquo; &mdash; a set of parameters you reuse across prompts. Include the same camera, lighting setup, color palette, and art style keywords every time. Save your best-performing prompts as templates and only change the subject while keeping style parameters identical. This produces a cohesive visual library instead of random one-offs.</p>
