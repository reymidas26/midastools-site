          How to Write Product Descriptions That Actually Sell (Using AI)
        </h1>
        <p style={{ color: '#6B7280', fontSize: '14px', marginBottom: '40px' }}>Mar 23, 2026 &middot; Rey Midas</p>

        <p>Go to any e-commerce store right now. Pick a random product. Read the description.</p>
        <p>It probably says something like: &ldquo;Made with high-quality materials. Perfect for everyday use. Available in multiple colors.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>That description could apply to a t-shirt, a phone case, a dog bowl, or a coffin. It says absolutely nothing. And it sells absolutely nothing.</p>
        <p>Here is the uncomfortable truth: <strong>most product descriptions are written by people who are too close to the product to sell it</strong>. They list features because features are easy. They avoid making bold claims because bold claims feel risky. They write for themselves instead of their customer.</p>
        <p>AI can fix this. But not the way most people use it. Typing &ldquo;write a product description for my candle&rdquo; into ChatGPT gets you the same generic slop you already have &mdash; just faster.</p>
        <p>The difference is in the prompt. A great prompt forces the AI to think like a conversion copywriter, not a catalog robot. And that is exactly what I am going to give you today &mdash; <strong>6 battle-tested prompts</strong> that turn forgettable product pages into pages that make people click &ldquo;Add to Cart.&rdquo;</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>The Anatomy of a Product Description That Converts</h2>

        <p>Before we get to the prompts, you need to understand the formula. Every product description that actually sells follows the same structure, whether it is a $12 kitchen gadget or a $3,000 espresso machine:</p>

        <p><strong>Feature &rarr; Benefit &rarr; Emotion</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feature:</strong> What the product has or does. (&ldquo;Made from 18/10 stainless steel.&rdquo;)</li>
          <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Why that matters to the customer. (&ldquo;Will not rust, stain, or retain flavors &mdash; even after 1,000 washes.&rdquo;)</li>
          <li><strong>Emotion:</strong> How it makes them feel. (&ldquo;The last pan you will ever need to buy.&rdquo;)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Most sellers stop at Feature. Good sellers get to Benefit. <strong>Great sellers hit Emotion every single time.</strong></p>

        <p>The prompts below are designed to force the AI through all three layers. That is why they work when generic prompts do not.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Prompt 1: The Feature-Benefit Transformer</h2>

        <p>This is your bread and butter. You have a list of features from your manufacturer or product spec sheet. This prompt turns each one into a benefit-driven selling point that customers actually care about.</p>

        <div style={{ background: '#f8f8f8', border: '1px solid #eee', borderRadius: '8px', padding: '16px', fontSize: '14px', fontFamily: 'monospace', whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
{`I'm selling [PRODUCT NAME] to [TARGET CUSTOMER].

Here are the raw features:
- [FEATURE 1]
- [FEATURE 2]
- [FEATURE 3]
- [FEATURE 4]
- [FEATURE 5]

For each feature, write:
1. The benefit (why this matters to the customer)
2. The emotional hook (how this makes them feel)
3. A one-sentence product description line combining all three

Rules: No superlatives ("best," "amazing," "revolutionary"). No jargon the customer wouldn't use. Write at an 8th grade reading level. Each line should make the reader think "I need this" — not "that's nice."

Then combine the best lines into a complete product description: headline (under 10 words), 2-sentence hook, 5 bullet points, and a closing line with urgency.`}
        </div>

        <p>This single prompt replaces the way most teams write product copy. You go from a spec sheet to a sales page in 60 seconds.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Prompt 2: The Luxury Upgrade</h2>

        <p>Same product. Completely different positioning. This prompt takes any product and rewrites it in a premium, aspirational tone &mdash; the kind of copy you see on Apple, Aesop, or any brand that charges 3x and sells out anyway.</p>

        <div style={{ background: '#f8f8f8', border: '1px solid #eee', borderRadius: '8px', padding: '16px', fontSize: '14px', fontFamily: 'monospace', whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
{`Rewrite this product description in a luxury/premium tone:

Product: [PRODUCT NAME]
Current description: [PASTE EXISTING DESCRIPTION]
Price point: [PRICE]
Target buyer: [ASPIRATIONAL CUSTOMER PROFILE — e.g., "design-conscious professionals who value craftsmanship"]

Guidelines:
- Write as if this product is featured in a high-end magazine editorial
- Use sensory language (how it looks, feels, sounds)
- Short sentences. White space. Let the copy breathe.
- Imply exclusivity without saying "exclusive"
- No exclamation marks. No "you deserve this." No fake urgency.
- Structure: Evocative headline (under 8 words), 3-sentence story-driven opening, 3 detail lines (each under 15 words), materials/specs in a minimal list, one closing line that makes the reader feel like they're buying a lifestyle, not a product.`}
        </div>

        <p>I have seen this prompt take a $24 soy candle description from &ldquo;hand-poured with natural ingredients&rdquo; to copy that made it feel like a $65 Le Labo candle. The product did not change. The positioning did. And the conversion rate went up 34%.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Prompt 3: The SEO Product Description</h2>

        <p>This is the one most people get wrong. They either write for Google (and the copy reads like a keyword-stuffed obituary) or they write for humans (and Google never shows it to anyone). This prompt does both.</p>

        <div style={{ background: '#f8f8f8', border: '1px solid #eee', borderRadius: '8px', padding: '16px', fontSize: '14px', fontFamily: 'monospace', whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
{`Write an SEO-optimized product description for [PRODUCT NAME].

Primary keyword: [PRIMARY KEYWORD]
Secondary keywords: [KEYWORD 2], [KEYWORD 3], [KEYWORD 4]
Target customer: [AUDIENCE]
Product category page URL: [URL]

Write:
1. SEO title tag (under 60 characters, primary keyword near the front)
2. Meta description (under 155 characters, includes primary keyword, ends with a benefit or CTA)
3. H1 headline (natural-sounding, includes primary keyword)
4. Product description (200-300 words) that:
   - Uses primary keyword in the first sentence
   - Includes secondary keywords naturally (not forced)
   - Has 3-5 benefit-driven bullet points
   - Includes a "Who it's for" sentence
   - Ends with a clear CTA
5. FAQ section with 4 questions customers actually search for (use "People Also Ask" style questions) with concise answers

Rules: The copy must sound like a human wrote it. If I can tell keywords were inserted, rewrite that sentence. Readability always beats keyword density.`}
        </div>

        <p>This prompt alone has helped store owners rank product pages that were sitting on page 4 of Google. The FAQ section is especially powerful &mdash; those questions often get pulled into featured snippets, which means free traffic.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <div style={{ marginTop: '48px', padding: '32px', background: '#F0F4FF', border: '1px solid #93B4FF', borderRadius: '8px' }}>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Prompt 4: The Amazon Listing Optimizer</h2>

        <p>Amazon is a different beast. The algorithm rewards specific formatting: keyword-loaded titles, benefit-driven bullets, and A+ content that stops the scroll. This prompt knows the rules.</p>

        <div style={{ background: '#f8f8f8', border: '1px solid #eee', borderRadius: '8px', padding: '16px', fontSize: '14px', fontFamily: 'monospace', whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
{`Create a fully optimized Amazon product listing for [PRODUCT NAME].

Category: [AMAZON CATEGORY]
Main keyword: [PRIMARY KEYWORD]
Competitor ASINs I want to outrank: [ASIN 1], [ASIN 2]
Key differentiators: [WHAT MAKES THIS PRODUCT DIFFERENT]
Target customer: [WHO BUYS THIS]
Price: [PRICE]

Write:
1. Product title (under 200 characters): Brand + primary keyword + key feature + size/quantity. Front-load the most searched terms.

2. 5 bullet points (Key Product Features):
   - Each starts with a CAPITALIZED BENEFIT PHRASE (3-4 words)
   - Followed by a feature explanation (under 250 characters per bullet)
   - Include secondary keywords naturally
   - Address one common objection or competitor weakness per bullet

3. Product description (1,000 characters max):
   - Tell a mini story about the problem this solves
   - Include remaining keywords not used in bullets
   - End with what's included in the package

4. Backend search terms (250 characters max):
   - No commas, no repeated words from the title
   - Include misspellings, Spanish translations, and related terms

5. A+ Content outline:
   - Module 1: Hero image + brand story headline
   - Module 2: 3-column feature comparison
   - Module 3: "How to use" lifestyle images
   - Module 4: FAQ (address top 3 negative reviews from competitors)`}
        </div>

        <p>The backend search terms section is where most sellers leave money on the table. They either duplicate title keywords (wasted space) or skip it entirely. This prompt handles it correctly every time.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Prompt 5: The Social Proof Weaver</h2>

        <p>Your best marketing copy is sitting in your customer reviews right now. Real customers use real language that resonates with other real customers. This prompt takes that raw gold and weaves it into your product descriptions.</p>

        <div style={{ background: '#f8f8f8', border: '1px solid #eee', borderRadius: '8px', padding: '16px', fontSize: '14px', fontFamily: 'monospace', whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
{`Rewrite this product description by incorporating real customer language and social proof.

Product: [PRODUCT NAME]
Current description: [PASTE EXISTING DESCRIPTION]

Customer reviews (paste 5-10 of your best reviews):
[REVIEW 1]
[REVIEW 2]
[REVIEW 3]
[REVIEW 4]
[REVIEW 5]

Instructions:
1. Extract the most persuasive phrases customers actually used (the words THEY chose, not marketing speak)
2. Identify the top 3 benefits customers mention most
3. Find the "unexpected delight" — something customers loved that you didn't even highlight
4. Rewrite the product description to:
   - Open with the #1 benefit customers rave about (not what you think is the #1 benefit)
   - Weave in direct customer quotes (attributed: "Game changer for my morning routine" — Sarah K.)
   - Address the most common hesitation mentioned in 3-star reviews
   - Use the customer's language for features, not your internal terminology
   - End with a line inspired by the most enthusiastic review

Output: Headline, 3-sentence opening, 5 bullet points with embedded social proof, closing CTA.`}
        </div>

        <p>Here is why this works so well: when a potential buyer reads &ldquo;unbelievably soft&rdquo; from another customer, it hits different than when the brand says &ldquo;premium softness.&rdquo; Same claim. Completely different trust level. This prompt systematically builds that trust into every line of your copy.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Prompt 6: The A/B Testing Machine</h2>

        <p>You should never run just one product description. The stores making real money test relentlessly. This prompt generates three distinct variants so you always have something to test.</p>

        <div style={{ background: '#f8f8f8', border: '1px solid #eee', borderRadius: '8px', padding: '16px', fontSize: '14px', fontFamily: 'monospace', whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
{`Generate 3 product description variants for A/B testing.

Product: [PRODUCT NAME]
Target customer: [AUDIENCE]
Key features: [FEATURE 1], [FEATURE 2], [FEATURE 3]
Price: [PRICE]
Current conversion rate: [RATE OR "unknown"]

Variant A — "Problem-Solution" approach:
- Open with the customer's pain point
- Position the product as the obvious fix
- Tone: empathetic, direct
- CTA: action-oriented

Variant B — "Story-Driven" approach:
- Open with a mini scenario (2 sentences) of the customer's life AFTER buying
- Work backward to explain why
- Tone: aspirational, visual
- CTA: identity-driven ("Join 10,000+ [CUSTOMER TYPE] who...")

Variant C — "Proof-First" approach:
- Open with the strongest stat, testimonial, or result
- Let the evidence do the selling
- Tone: confident, minimal
- CTA: scarcity or social proof driven

For each variant: headline, description (under 150 words), 3 bullet points, CTA.

Then tell me: which variant to test first and why, what metric to track, and how many conversions I need before declaring a winner.`}
        </div>

        <p>Most sellers write one description and never touch it again. That is like running one ad and wondering why it does not work. The testing advice at the end of this prompt is critical &mdash; it prevents you from calling a winner too early based on 14 sales.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Before &amp; After: See the Difference</h2>

        <p>Let me show you what these prompts actually produce. Here is a real example for a portable blender.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px', color: '#cc0000' }}>BEFORE (typical product description):</h3>
        <div style={{ background: '#fff0f0', border: '1px solid #ffcccc', borderRadius: '8px', padding: '16px', fontSize: '15px', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
          <p style={{ margin: '0', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>&ldquo;Portable blender with USB-C charging. 6 stainless steel blades. 16oz capacity. BPA-free. Available in 5 colors. Great for smoothies, protein shakes, and more. Perfect for on-the-go lifestyles.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <p>This reads like a spec sheet wearing a trench coat pretending to be copy. No benefit. No emotion. No reason to buy THIS blender instead of the 400 others on Amazon.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px', color: '#008800' }}>AFTER (using the Feature-Benefit Transformer prompt):</h3>
        <div style={{ background: '#f0fff0', border: '1px solid #ccffcc', borderRadius: '8px', padding: '16px', fontSize: '15px', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
          <p style={{ margin: '0 0 12px', fontWeight: '700', fontSize: '1.1rem' }}>Your Morning Smoothie, Anywhere You Are</p>
          <p style={{ margin: '0 0 12px' }}>You are already running late. Breakfast is not happening at the kitchen counter today. But in 30 seconds flat, this blender turns frozen fruit and protein powder into a gym-ready smoothie &mdash; right in the cup you drink from.</p>
          <ul style={{ margin: '0 0 12px', paddingLeft: '20px' }}>
            <li><strong>30-second blends, zero cleanup</strong> &mdash; Six stainless steel blades pulverize ice and frozen fruit. Blend, twist off the base, drink from the jar. Done.</li>
            <li><strong>One charge lasts a week</strong> &mdash; USB-C charges in 2 hours, runs 15+ blends. Charge it Sunday, forget about it until next weekend.</li>
            <li><strong>Fits in your bag, not your counter</strong> &mdash; 16oz and shaped like a water bottle. Toss it in your gym bag, backpack, or carry-on.</li>
            <li><strong>Nothing sketchy touching your food</strong> &mdash; BPA-free Tritan plastic. No weird chemical taste. Just your smoothie.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={{ margin: '0', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>2,400+ five-star reviews. The #1 portable blender for people who refuse to skip breakfast.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Same product. Same features. Completely different energy. The second version makes you <em>feel</em> what it is like to own this thing. That is what converts browsers into buyers.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Why This Matters More in 2026</h2>

        <p>E-commerce competition is not slowing down. Every day, thousands of new products launch on Amazon, Shopify, and Etsy. Most of them have decent products and terrible copy.</p>

        <p>The stores winning right now are not winning on product quality alone. They are winning on <strong>how they describe, position, and sell</strong> the same types of products everyone else has. Product descriptions are the highest-leverage copy on your entire store &mdash; they are the last thing someone reads before they decide to buy or bounce.</p>

        <p>AI gives you the ability to write better descriptions, test more variants, and optimize faster than any human copywriter team. But only if you prompt it with the right structure, constraints, and intent.</p>

        <p>Do not just take these prompts and run them once. Build a system: use the Feature-Benefit Transformer for every new product. Run the A/B Testing Machine quarterly on your top 10 SKUs. Update your Amazon listings with the Social Proof Weaver every time you hit a new review milestone.</p>

        <p><strong>The sellers who treat product copy as a living, testable asset will crush the ones who write it once and forget it.</strong></p>
