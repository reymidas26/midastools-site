        <h1>{title}</h1>

        <p>
          Anthropic shipped <strong>Claude Opus 4.7</strong> on April 16, 2026 — their most capable generally available model.
          It is <em>not</em> a faster Sonnet. It's a different tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Opus 4.7 earns its price when the job has three shapes: <strong>deep reasoning, long context, and tool use with
          verification</strong>. Anything else, Sonnet is cheaper and often ties. These 14 prompts are the ones I actually reach
          for when I'm spending Opus tokens.
        </p>

        <div className="blog-tip">
          <p>
            <strong>Rough rule:</strong> if the prompt fits on one screen and the output is under 800 words,{' '}
            <strong>Sonnet first, Opus only if Sonnet disappoints</strong>. Keep receipts — if you can't name which jobs
            Opus materially improved, you're probably paying for Opus when you don't need to.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>TL;DR — the 14 prompts</h2>
        <table className="tldr-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>#</th>
              <th>Prompt</th>
              <th>When to reach for Opus 4.7</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            {prompts.map(p => (
              <tr key={p.n}>
                <td>{p.n}</td>
                <td><strong>{p.title}</strong></td>
                <td>{p.use}</td>
              </tr>
            ))}
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>When Opus 4.7 beats the alternative (and when it doesn't)</h2>
        <p>The right model depends on the shape of the job, not the prestige of the label:</p>
        <table className="model-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Job</th>

            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Deep reasoning, long context, tool use</td>
              <td><strong>Claude Opus 4.7</strong></td>
              <td>Strongest on SWE-bench-class tasks; holds 200k ctx well</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Bulk writing, tight prose under 4k tokens</td>
              <td>Claude 4.5 Sonnet</td>

              <td>GPT-5.4 Pro / GPT-4o</td>
              <td>Tool and plugin density, mobile quality</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Cost-sensitive batch work</td>
              <td>DeepSeek V3.1 / Llama 3.3 70B</td>
              <td>5–20× cheaper per token, good enough for 80% of jobs</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Restricted frontier (not public)</td>

        </table>

        <h2>The universal Opus 4.7 prompt formula</h2>
        <p>Opus 4.7 rewards structured prompts more than any previous Claude tier. Five slots:</p>
        <div className="blog-code">
          <pre>{`[ROLE]:         who the model is writing as (senior reviewer, counsel, architect)
[CONTEXT]:      the domain, stage, constraints
[INPUTS]:       every file, transcript, doc pasted — label each one
[TASK]:         the deliverable shape (table, ranked list, one-pager, 3 options)
[VERIFICATION]: how the model should check its own work before finalizing`}</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          The <strong>VERIFICATION</strong> slot is what separates Opus 4.7 prompts from Sonnet ones. Ask Opus to{' '}
          <em>verify, cite, flag uncertainty, and push back</em>. It will. Sonnet tends to comply; Opus tends to correct.
        </p>
        <p>

          you ship — it'll flag missing slots before Opus gives you a watered-down answer.

        <h2>Common mistakes people make with Opus 4.7</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Using Opus for jobs Sonnet handles.</strong> If the output is under 800 words and the input fits on one
            screen, Sonnet first. Opus when Sonnet disappoints.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Skipping the VERIFICATION slot.</strong> Opus is uniquely good at self-checking. A prompt without
            "check your work, flag uncertainty" wastes the model's best feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pasting 150k tokens without labels.</strong> Long context works, but only if each source is clearly
            delimited. Use <code>--- SOURCE N: [label] ---</code> blocks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Treating it as a yes-man.</strong> Add "if this plan is weak, say so" and "if the evidence doesn't support
            the claim, say so." Opus will push back; most prompts don't give it permission.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not measuring.</strong> If you're spending Opus tokens and can't name which jobs got materially better,
            run the same 3 prompts through Sonnet and Opus, judge blind, keep receipts.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The bottom line</h2>
        <p>
          Claude Opus 4.7 is the most capable public Claude tier Anthropic has shipped. But most people are using it the way
          they used Sonnet — one-shot prompts, no verification slot, no labeled long-context. That's how you pay 5× for a
          result that was 1.1× better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Structure the prompt (five slots), pick the right model for the job (not the highest-prestige one), and ask Opus to
          push back on you. Those three moves are the difference between "Opus feels expensive" and "Opus earns its bill."
