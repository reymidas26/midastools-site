The trend became so popular that it crashed ChatGPT, with over 13,000 outage reports on Downdetector.

Simply describe your appearance in the prompt — hair color and style, skin tone, glasses, facial hair, body type, typical outfit. ChatGPT will generate a caricature based on your description combined with your job details. However, uploading a photo produces a much more accurate likeness and is how most viral caricatures are made. If privacy is a concern, the text-only approach works well for a fun, representative caricature that captures your professional identity without being an exact portrait.'

For free alternatives, you can use prompt generators like the Midas Tools Caricature Generator to craft optimized prompts and then paste them into any AI image tool.

        <p>First it was Ghibli-style portraits. Then action figures. Then Pixar characters. But the trend that actually <strong>broke ChatGPT</strong> &mdash; literally crashed the servers with over 13,000 outage reports on Downdetector &mdash; was none of those.</p>
        <p>It was <strong>caricatures</strong>.</p>
        <p>The ChatGPT caricature trend exploded in early 2026 when people discovered they could ask ChatGPT to create a humorous, exaggerated cartoon illustration of themselves and their job. The results were so shareable, so funny, and so weirdly accurate that the trend went supernova across every social platform simultaneously. Fast Company covered it. Fox10 reported on it. Creative Bloq analyzed the art style. Gulf News ran features on it. LinkedIn feeds became nothing but caricatures for weeks.</p>
        <p>And the prompt that started it all? Deceptively simple:</p>

        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Create a caricature of me and my job based on everything you know about me.`}
        </div>

        <p>That single sentence, combined with a photo upload, generated millions of images. People shared their caricatures showing themselves as overwhelmed teachers buried in papers, developers surrounded by monitors and coffee cups, nurses juggling a dozen things at once, and chefs in chaotic kitchens. The humor was universal. The relatability was instant. And the shareability was off the charts.</p>
        <p>But here is the thing most people discovered the hard way: that basic prompt produces decent results, but <strong>specific, detailed prompts produce incredible results</strong>. The caricatures that went truly viral &mdash; the ones that made people tag their coworkers and say &ldquo;this is so accurate it hurts&rdquo; &mdash; used prompts with far more detail about their profession, workspace, personality quirks, and preferred art style.</p>
        <p>This guide gives you everything you need. The story behind the trend, a step-by-step walkthrough, <strong>5 profession-specific prompts</strong> you can copy and paste right now, pro tips for getting the best results, and a link to our free Caricature Generator that builds the perfect prompt for you in seconds.</p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>What Is the ChatGPT Caricature Trend?</h2>
        <p>A caricature is a style of illustration where certain features &mdash; physical traits, personality characteristics, professional habits &mdash; are deliberately exaggerated for humorous or satirical effect. Traditional caricatures have been around for centuries, from political cartoons to boardwalk sketch artists. What makes the ChatGPT version different is that the AI combines visual exaggeration with <strong>contextual knowledge about professions</strong>.</p>
        <p>When you tell ChatGPT your job title and upload a photo, it does not just draw a cartoon of your face. It builds an entire scene: your typical workspace, the tools you use, the chaos (or calm) of your daily routine, the inside jokes of your profession, and the personality traits that come with the territory. A project manager gets drawn surrounded by Gantt charts, sticky notes, and a calendar that is on fire. A software developer sits in a dark room illuminated only by four monitors, empty energy drink cans stacked like a pyramid, with a rubber duck on the desk.</p>
        <p>The results tap into something deeply relatable. People see their entire professional identity captured in a single exaggerated illustration, and the natural response is to share it. That shareability is what made this the biggest AI image trend of 2026 so far.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Why It Crashed ChatGPT</h3>
        <p>On the peak day of the trend, Downdetector registered over <strong>13,000 outage reports</strong> for ChatGPT. OpenAI confirmed that image generation demand had surged far beyond normal capacity. The caricature trend was not the only contributor, but it was the primary driver. Unlike other image trends that appealed to niche communities, the &ldquo;caricature of me and my job&rdquo; prompt resonated with <em>everyone who has a job</em> &mdash; which is nearly every ChatGPT user. The combination of universal appeal, low barrier to entry (one simple prompt), and extreme shareability created a perfect storm of demand.</p>
        <p>Sam Altman even acknowledged the surge on X, noting the unprecedented demand for image generation. OpenAI had to temporarily throttle free-tier image generations and implement rate limiting to stabilize the service.</p>

        {/* ============================================ */}

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>How to Create Your Job Caricature: Step-by-Step</h2>
        <p>Creating your own caricature takes about 2 minutes if you use a basic prompt, or 5 minutes if you want a highly customized result. Here is the complete process.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Step 1: Open ChatGPT with GPT-4o</h3>
        <p>You need GPT-4o for image generation. This is available on ChatGPT Free (with daily limits), ChatGPT Plus ($20/month with higher limits), and ChatGPT Pro ($200/month with the highest limits). Go to <strong>chat.openai.com</strong> and make sure the model selector shows GPT-4o. If you see GPT-3.5, switch to 4o &mdash; the older model cannot generate images.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Step 2: Upload a Photo (Optional but Recommended)</h3>
        <p>The viral caricatures that get the most engagement include the person&rsquo;s actual likeness. Click the attachment icon in the ChatGPT chat window and upload a clear, well-lit photo of yourself. A headshot or upper-body shot works best. Make sure your face is clearly visible and not obscured by shadows or accessories. If you do not want to upload a photo, you can describe your appearance in the prompt instead &mdash; but the likeness will not be as accurate.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Step 3: Write Your Prompt</h3>
        <p>The basic viral prompt is:</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Create a caricature of me and my job based on everything you know about me.`}
        </div>
        <p>This works if you have an existing conversation history with ChatGPT and it already knows your profession. But for the best results, be explicit. Here is a stronger version:</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Create a colorful, humorous caricature illustration of me at my job as a [YOUR JOB TITLE]. Show me in my typical workspace surrounded by the tools, objects, and chaos of my daily routine. Exaggerate the most relatable aspects of my profession for comedic effect. Include props like [LIST 3-4 SPECIFIC ITEMS]. The style should be a vibrant editorial cartoon illustration with bold outlines and expressive features. Make it funny but affectionate — the kind of image that makes someone in my profession say "this is painfully accurate."`}
        </div>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Step 4: Customize and Iterate</h3>
        <p>Your first result will be 70&ndash;80% of the way there. This is normal. Look at what ChatGPT generated and then refine. Tell it: &ldquo;Add a whiteboard covered in illegible diagrams in the background,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Make the coffee cup bigger and add steam coming off it,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Make my expression more frantic.&rdquo; Each iteration gets closer to the perfect caricature. Two or three rounds of refinement usually produce the best results.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Step 5: Download and Share</h3>
        <p>Once you are happy with the result, click the download button on the image. The most popular platforms for sharing are LinkedIn (where it performs extremely well because of the professional context), Instagram Stories, Twitter/X, and TikTok. Tag your coworkers. Tag your industry. Use hashtags like #ChatGPTCaricature, #AICaricature, and #MyJobCaricature. The more profession-specific your caricature, the more engagement it tends to get.</p>

        <p>These prompts have been tested and refined for maximum impact. Each one is designed for a specific profession, but you can easily adapt them by swapping out the job-specific details. Upload your photo alongside any of these for the best results.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>1. The Teacher / Professor</h3>
        <p>This prompt captures the beautiful chaos of education &mdash; the grading pile that never ends, the coffee that is never strong enough, and the students who are definitely not paying attention.</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Create a vibrant, humorous caricature illustration of a teacher at work. The teacher (who looks like the person in the attached photo) is standing at the front of a chaotic classroom. They are holding a dry-erase marker in one hand and a massive coffee mug that says "World's Most Patient Human" in the other. Their expression is a mix of enthusiasm and exhaustion — eyes wide, smile slightly strained, hair slightly disheveled.

The scene around them is lovingly chaotic:
- A whiteboard behind them covered in notes, diagrams, and one student's doodle that somehow ended up there
- A towering stack of ungraded papers on the desk that is visibly leaning
- A desk covered in sticky notes, hand sanitizer, a half-eaten granola bar, and 3 different colored pens
- A classroom of students in the background — one is raising their hand, one is asleep, one is on their phone, and one is actually taking notes
- An Apple on the desk because of course there is
- A motivational poster on the wall that says something slightly absurd like "Believe in Your Semicolons"

The art style should be a colorful editorial cartoon illustration with bold outlines, exaggerated expressions, and warm colors. Think New Yorker cartoon meets Pixar character design. The overall tone is funny, warm, and deeply relatable to anyone who has ever taught.`}
        </div>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>2. The Software Developer</h3>
        <p>Dark mode everything, caffeine dependency, and the eternal battle between &ldquo;it works on my machine&rdquo; and production being on fire.</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Create a humorous, detailed caricature illustration of a software developer at work. The developer (who looks like the person in the attached photo) is sitting in a dark room illuminated primarily by the glow of multiple monitors. Their expression is one of intense focus mixed with mild existential dread.

The scene includes:
- Three monitors: one showing code with a syntax error highlighted in red, one showing a Slack channel with 47 unread messages, one showing Stack Overflow
- A mechanical keyboard with custom keycaps and RGB lighting
- A pyramid of empty energy drink cans and/or coffee cups stacked impossibly high
- A rubber duck sitting on the desk (for debugging, obviously)
- Noise-canceling headphones around their neck
- A hoodie — they are definitely wearing a hoodie
- Sticky notes on the monitor bezel that say things like "DO NOT DEPLOY ON FRIDAY" and "TODO: fix later"
- A plant on the desk that is somehow alive despite never seeing sunlight
- In the background, a server rack or cloud icon with tiny flames coming off it
- Their desk setup is immaculate despite the chaos of their screen

Art style: colorful editorial cartoon with bold outlines. The lighting should contrast the dark room with the bright screens. Think tech-industry humor meets New Yorker illustration. Funny, nerdy, and painfully relatable to anyone in software engineering.`}
        </div>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>3. The Nurse / Healthcare Worker</h3>
        <p>The real superheroes &mdash; juggling twelve things simultaneously, keeping calm under pressure, and surviving entirely on vending machine snacks.</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Create a vibrant, humorous caricature illustration of a nurse at work. The nurse (who looks like the person in the attached photo) is shown in the middle of a busy hospital corridor, multi-tasking at a superhuman level. Their expression is calm and competent on the surface, but one eye is slightly twitching.

The scene includes:
- They are simultaneously holding a clipboard, an IV bag, a medication cup, and somehow also a cup of coffee
- Scrubs covered in various unidentifiable stains that they have stopped caring about
- A stethoscope around their neck
- A fanny pack or pocket organizer overflowing with pens, scissors, tape, and saline flushes
- Comfortable shoes (extremely important, exaggerate how worn they are)
- In the background: a call light going off, a patient in a wheelchair waving, a doctor looking lost
- A break room door visible in the far background with a sign that says "15-min break" — but it is covered in cobwebs suggesting it has never been used
- A small motivational badge on their lanyard that says something like "I'm here for the parking" or "Runs on caffeine and compassion"
- A clock on the wall showing it is hour 11 of a 12-hour shift

Art style: warm, colorful editorial cartoon with bold outlines and expressive features. The tone should be humorous and deeply appreciative — celebrating the absurdity and heroism of nursing. Think Pixar-warmth meets editorial illustration.`}
        </div>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>4. The Chef / Restaurant Worker</h3>
        <p>Fire, knives, tickets piling up, and the beautiful madness of a professional kitchen.</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Create a dynamic, humorous caricature illustration of a chef in the middle of a busy restaurant kitchen. The chef (who looks like the person in the attached photo) is in full action — one hand tossing something in a flaming saut\u00e9 pan, the other reaching for a squeeze bottle, with pure adrenaline-fueled focus on their face.

The scene includes:
- A chef's coat that was white at the start of the shift but is now a Jackson Pollock painting of sauces
- A kitchen that is organized chaos: flames shooting from burners, steam billowing, multiple pans going at once
- A ticket rail above them absolutely stuffed with order tickets, some hanging down to eye level
- Knives of various sizes magnetically mounted on the wall behind them
- Mise en place containers in various states of fullness
- A line cook in the background looking panicked while holding a plate
- A timer going off that nobody is attending to
- A tiny burn mark collection on their forearms (the chef's tattoo)
- Somewhere visible: a bottle of hot sauce and a roll of paper towels — the two constants

Art style: energetic editorial cartoon with bold, warm colors — lots of oranges, reds, and yellows to capture the heat of the kitchen. Dynamic composition with motion lines. The energy should feel like a Gordon Ramsay episode. Funny, chaotic, and full of respect for the craft.`}
        </div>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>5. The Marketing Professional</h3>
        <p>Metrics, meetings, trends, and the eternal pursuit of content that &ldquo;goes viral.&rdquo;</p>
        <div style={promptBlockStyle}>
{`Create a humorous, detailed caricature illustration of a marketing professional at work. The marketer (who looks like the person in the attached photo) is sitting at a desk surrounded by the tools and chaos of modern digital marketing. Their expression is a confident smile masking the stress of 14 browser tabs.

The scene includes:
- A laptop screen showing an analytics dashboard with one metric going up (highlighted proudly) and several going down (minimized)
- A second monitor showing a social media feed with a content calendar color-coded to the point of absurdity
- Their desk has: a ring light (for LinkedIn videos), a branded coffee mug, a copy of "Building a StoryBrand," and a fidget spinner
- Post-it notes everywhere with phrases like "synergy," "let's circle back," "make it viral," and "per my last email"
- Behind them: a whiteboard with a content funnel diagram, a brand color palette, and the word "ENGAGEMENT" written in huge letters and underlined three times
- A phone showing 23 notification badges across various social media apps
- A trendy outfit — they are definitely on-brand even in their clothing
- In the background, someone walking by carrying a brief that just changed scope for the third time

Art style: bright, modern editorial cartoon with bold outlines and a clean color palette. Think AdAge illustration meets tech-startup energy. The humor should be self-aware — marketers laughing at themselves. Warm, clever, and extremely shareable (which is, of course, exactly what a marketer would want).`}

        {/* ============================================ */}

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>7 Tips for Better Caricature Results</h2>
        <p>After testing hundreds of caricature prompts, these are the techniques that consistently produce the best output.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 1: Be Specific About Props</h3>
        <p>Generic prompts produce generic results. &ldquo;A teacher in a classroom&rdquo; gives you a stock illustration. &ldquo;A teacher holding a dry-erase marker in one hand and a coffee mug that says &lsquo;I Teach, What&rsquo;s Your Superpower?&rsquo; in the other, standing in front of a whiteboard covered in half-erased algebra equations&rdquo; gives you something shareable. The props are what make the caricature feel personal. Think about the 3&ndash;5 objects that someone in your profession would immediately recognize as &ldquo;so accurate.&rdquo;</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 2: Describe Your Workspace, Not Just Yourself</h3>
        <p>The environment is half the caricature. A developer in a dark room with multiple monitors tells a completely different story than a developer in a bright open-plan office. Describe the lighting, the desk situation, what is on the walls, what is on the floor, and the general vibe of the space. Is it sterile and corporate? Is it creative chaos? Is it a home office with a cat walking across the keyboard? The workspace context is what makes people say &ldquo;this is literally my life.&rdquo;</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 3: Mention an Art Style Reference</h3>
        <p>ChatGPT can create caricatures in many different styles, and the default is not always the most engaging. Referencing a specific style dramatically improves the output. Try: &ldquo;New Yorker editorial cartoon style,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pixar character design with exaggerated proportions,&rdquo; &ldquo;classic newspaper caricature with ink outlines,&rdquo; or &ldquo;MAD Magazine illustration style.&rdquo; Each reference communicates volumes about the line work, color palette, and level of exaggeration you want.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 4: Include a Personality Trait or Quirk</h3>
        <p>The best caricatures are not just about the job &mdash; they capture <em>how</em> you do the job. Are you the person who is always early to meetings? The one with 47 browser tabs open? The one who stress-bakes during deadlines? The one who color-codes everything? Including a personal quirk makes the caricature feel like it was drawn by someone who actually knows you, which is what makes it special enough to share.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 5: Use a Clear, Well-Lit Photo</h3>
        <p>If you want the caricature to actually look like you, the photo quality matters. Use a photo where your face is clearly visible, well-lit, and not obscured by sunglasses, hats, or heavy shadows. A straight-on headshot or a 3/4 angle works best. Avoid group photos &mdash; ChatGPT sometimes picks the wrong person. Professional headshots and good selfies both work well. The better the input photo, the stronger the likeness in the caricature.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 6: Specify the Exaggeration Level</h3>
        <p>Caricatures exist on a spectrum from &ldquo;gentle cartoon&rdquo; to &ldquo;wildly exaggerated.&rdquo; If you want something you would actually post on LinkedIn, ask for &ldquo;a warm, affectionate caricature with mild exaggeration.&rdquo; If you want maximum humor, ask for &ldquo;extreme caricature with heavily exaggerated features and comedic proportions.&rdquo; Without guidance, ChatGPT tends to land in the middle, which is fine but may not match your intent.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>Tip 7: Iterate Instead of Starting Over</h3>
        <p>When the first result is close but not perfect, do <strong>not</strong> start a new prompt from scratch. Tell ChatGPT what to change: &ldquo;Make the coffee cup larger,&rdquo; &ldquo;Add a cat sleeping on the keyboard,&rdquo; &ldquo;Change the expression to look more exhausted,&rdquo; &ldquo;Add more sticky notes to the background.&rdquo; ChatGPT remembers the context and adjusts incrementally. This almost always produces better results than re-rolling from zero, and it saves your daily generation quota.</p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Why the Caricature Trend Went More Viral Than Any Other AI Image Trend</h2>
        <p>Every few weeks, a new AI image trend sweeps social media. Ghibli portraits were huge. Action figures were massive. Pixar characters had their moment. But the caricature trend surpassed them all in reach and speed. Here is why.</p>
        <p><strong>Universal relevance.</strong> Not everyone identifies with a specific art style like Ghibli or wants to see themselves as an action figure. But everyone has a job, and everyone can relate to the absurdities of their profession. The caricature trend had the widest possible audience: anyone who works.</p>
        <p><strong>Built-in humor.</strong> The exaggeration inherent in caricatures makes them inherently funny. People did not just share their caricatures &mdash; they shared them with commentary like &ldquo;ChatGPT did NOT have to come for me like this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why is this more accurate than my actual job description.&rdquo; The humor drove engagement far beyond a simple &ldquo;look at this cool AI image.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><strong>Professional identity.</strong> People take pride in their jobs, even (especially) the stressful parts. A caricature that captures the chaos of nursing or the absurdity of marketing feels like a badge of honor. It says &ldquo;I live this.&rdquo; That emotional resonance is what makes people tag their coworkers, share to industry-specific groups, and repost across multiple platforms.</p>
        <p><strong>Low barrier to entry.</strong> One prompt. One photo upload. No technical knowledge required. The simplicity of the original viral prompt (&ldquo;create a caricature of me and my job&rdquo;) meant that anyone could participate, regardless of their AI experience. This is the hallmark of every trend that truly goes mainstream.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>What is the ChatGPT caricature trend?</h3>
        <p>The ChatGPT caricature trend is a viral social media phenomenon from early 2026 where people ask ChatGPT to create a humorous, exaggerated cartoon illustration of themselves and their job. Users upload a photo and type a prompt like &ldquo;create a caricature of me and my job,&rdquo; and ChatGPT generates a detailed illustration showing them surrounded by profession-specific objects, tools, and scenarios with comedic exaggeration. The trend became so popular it crashed ChatGPT, generating over 13,000 outage reports. It was covered by Fast Company, Fox10, Creative Bloq, Gulf News, and many other major publications.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>How do I create a caricature of myself with ChatGPT?</h3>
        <p>Open ChatGPT and make sure you are using GPT-4o, which has image generation. Optionally upload a clear photo of yourself. Then type a prompt describing the caricature you want &mdash; the simplest version is &ldquo;create a caricature of me and my job based on everything you know about me.&rdquo; For better results, specify your job title, 3&ndash;4 profession-specific props, your typical workspace, and your preferred art style. Free users have limited daily image generations, while ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) gives significantly more.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>What&rsquo;s the best prompt for ChatGPT caricatures?</h3>
        <p>The original viral prompt is &ldquo;create a caricature of me and my job based on everything you know about me.&rdquo; For better results, try: &ldquo;Create a colorful, humorous caricature illustration of me at my job as a [JOB TITLE]. Show me in my typical workspace surrounded by the tools and chaos of my daily routine. Exaggerate the most relatable aspects of my profession for comedic effect. Include props like [LIST ITEMS]. Style: vibrant editorial cartoon with bold outlines.&rdquo; The more specific the props and workspace details, the more personalized and shareable the result.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Can I make a caricature without uploading a photo?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You can describe your appearance in the prompt instead &mdash; hair color and style, skin tone, glasses, facial hair, typical outfit. ChatGPT will generate a caricature based on your description combined with your job details. The result will not be an exact likeness, but it can still be a fun, representative illustration of your professional identity. That said, uploading a photo produces a much more accurate and shareable result, which is why most viral caricatures include one.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Which AI tools work best for caricatures?</h3>
        <p>ChatGPT with GPT-4o is the most popular and easiest option for the caricature trend. It understands professional context deeply and generates high-quality cartoon illustrations. Midjourney (v6+) produces excellent caricatures with more artistic control if you are comfortable with Discord-based prompting. Microsoft Copilot (which uses DALL-E 3) is a free alternative with daily limits. For optimized prompts, you can use our free <Link href="/caricature-generator" style={{ color: '#3B5FFF' }}>Caricature Generator</Link> to build a detailed prompt in seconds and paste it into any AI image tool.</p>
