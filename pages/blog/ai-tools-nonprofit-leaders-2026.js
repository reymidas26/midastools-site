          <p style={s.p}>
            Nonprofits face a brutal paradox: the organizations that need efficiency the most can afford it the least. You need grant proposals, fundraising campaigns, donor reports, volunteer communications, social media content, and board presentations — but your team is already stretched thin.
          </p>
          <p style={s.p}>
            AI doesn't replace your passion or your people. It handles the repetitive writing, research, and communication tasks that eat up 40-60% of your week — so you can spend more time on the work that actually advances your mission.
          </p>
          <p style={s.p}>
            Here are 8 specific ways nonprofit leaders are using AI in 2026, with <strong>copy-paste prompts</strong> you can use today.
          </p>

          {/* Tool 1: Grant Writing */}
          <h2 style={s.h2}>1. AI Grant Writing — Cut Proposal Time by 70%</h2>
          <p style={s.p}>
            Grant writing is the most time-consuming task for most nonprofits — and the one where AI makes the biggest difference. A grant proposal that used to take 20-40 hours can be drafted in 3-5 hours with AI assistance.
          </p>
          <p style={s.p}><strong>Best tools:</strong> ChatGPT, Claude (best for long documents), Google Gemini</p>

          <h3 style={s.h3}>Needs Statement Generator</h3>
          <div style={s.prompt}>
{`You are a nonprofit grant writer with 15 years of experience winning federal and foundation grants.

Write a compelling needs statement for a grant proposal.

Organization: [YOUR NONPROFIT NAME]
Mission: [YOUR MISSION — e.g., "providing after-school tutoring to underserved students in [CITY]"]
Target population: [WHO YOU SERVE — e.g., "low-income students in grades 3-8"]
Problem: [THE CORE ISSUE — e.g., "65% of students in our district read below grade level"]
Geographic area: [WHERE — e.g., "East Side of [CITY], 3 neighborhoods"]

Requirements:
- 500-700 words
- Include 3-5 statistics with citations (use real, verifiable data)
- Show the gap between current services and need
- Connect the problem to broader systemic issues
- End with a bridge to the proposed solution (don't describe the solution yet)
- Tone: urgent but professional, data-driven but human`}
          </div>

          <h3 style={s.h3}>Program Description Writer</h3>
          <div style={s.prompt}>
{`Write the Program Description section for a grant proposal.

Program name: [NAME]
What we do: [DESCRIBE YOUR PROGRAM IN 2-3 SENTENCES]
How it works: [KEY ACTIVITIES — e.g., "weekly tutoring sessions, monthly parent workshops, summer reading program"]
Who delivers it: [STAFF/VOLUNTEERS — e.g., "8 certified teachers, 20 trained volunteers"]
Duration: [TIMELINE — e.g., "36-week academic year program"]
Participants: [NUMBER AND DEMOGRAPHICS]
Expected outcomes: [WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE — e.g., "80% of students improve reading scores by 1+ grade level"]

Structure the response as:
1. Program overview (2 paragraphs)
2. Activities and timeline (bullet points)
3. Staffing and qualifications (1 paragraph)
4. Evaluation plan (1 paragraph with specific metrics)

Keep it under 800 words. Use active voice. Be specific — funders want numbers, not generalizations.`}
          </div>

          {/* Tool 2: Fundraising Emails */}
          <h2 style={s.h2}>2. AI Fundraising Emails — Double Your Open Rates</h2>
          <p style={s.p}>
            Most nonprofit fundraising emails sound identical: "Dear friend, our work is important, please donate." AI helps you write emails that <strong>tell stories, create urgency, and make the donor the hero</strong> — the three elements that actually drive giving.
          </p>
          <p style={s.p}><strong>Best tools:</strong> ChatGPT, Claude</p>

          <h3 style={s.h3}>Year-End Appeal Email</h3>
          <div style={s.prompt}>
{`You are a nonprofit fundraising copywriter. Write a year-end appeal email.

Organization: [NAME]

Ask amount: [SUGGESTED DONATION — e.g., "$50 provides a week of meals"]
Deadline: December 31 (tax-deductible)

Requirements:
- Subject line (3 options, under 50 characters)
- Under 300 words (people skim)
- Open with the story, not the ask
- Make the donor the hero ("Your $50 means...")
- Include a specific, tangible impact statement
- One clear call-to-action button text
- P.S. line (these get read more than the body)
- Tone: warm, genuine, NOT guilt-based`}
          </div>

          <h3 style={s.h3}>Monthly Donor Acquisition Email</h3>
          <div style={s.prompt}>
{`Write an email converting one-time donors to monthly recurring donors.

Organization: [NAME]
Monthly ask: $[AMOUNT]/month
Impact of monthly giving: [WHAT IT FUNDS — e.g., "$25/month sponsors a student's after-school program for a full semester"]
Current donor relationship: They donated once [TIMEFRAME] ago

Make the case for monthly giving:
- Emphasize convenience and impact
- Show how small monthly amounts add up
- Address the "I already gave" objection
- Include a comparison: "$25/month = the cost of one coffee per week"
- Keep it under 250 words
- Warm, personal tone — this is about deepening a relationship, not making a sale`}
          </div>

          {/* Tool 3: Donor Communications */}
          <h2 style={s.h2}>3. AI Donor Reports & Thank-You Letters</h2>
          <p style={s.p}>
            Donor stewardship is where most nonprofits drop the ball. AI makes it easy to send personalized thank-you letters and impact reports — the two things that keep donors giving year after year.
          </p>

          <h3 style={s.h3}>Personalized Thank-You Letter</h3>

Giving history: [e.g., "3rd year of giving" / "first-time donor"]
Fund/program supported: [WHICH PROGRAM]
Specific impact: [WHAT THEIR GIFT FUNDED — e.g., "provided school supplies for 15 students"]

Requirements:
- Under 200 words
- Mention their specific gift and its impact in the first paragraph
- Include one brief story or update about the program they support
- If repeat donor: acknowledge their loyalty specifically
- Close with forward-looking excitement (what's next)
- Sign off from [EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NAME]
- Tone: genuinely grateful, specific, NOT form-letter`}

          <p style={s.p}>
            Most nonprofits know they should post on social media but don't have the bandwidth. AI can generate a month of content in an hour — stories, stats, calls-to-action, and awareness posts.
          </p>
          <p style={s.p}><strong>Best tools:</strong> ChatGPT, Canva AI (free for nonprofits), Buffer AI</p>

For each post, provide:

          {/* Tool 5: Volunteer Communications */}
          <h2 style={s.h2}>5. AI Volunteer Management — Recruit, Train, and Retain</h2>
          <p style={s.p}>

          <p style={s.p}>

          <h2 style={s.h2}>3 Tips for Using AI Ethically as a Nonprofit</h2>

          <p style={s.p}><strong>1. Be transparent.</strong> If you use AI to help write a grant or newsletter, that's fine — but don't misrepresent AI-generated content as original work when accuracy and authorship matter. Most funders care about the quality of your proposal, not whether you used AI to draft it.</p>

          <p style={s.p}><strong>2. Always verify data.</strong> AI can hallucinate statistics. Every number, citation, and claim in a grant proposal or impact report should be verified against your actual data. Use AI for the writing, not the facts.</p>

          <p style={s.p}><strong>3. Keep the human touch.</strong> AI writes the draft. You add the heart. The most effective nonprofit communications blend AI efficiency with authentic stories and genuine emotion that only your team can provide.</p>
