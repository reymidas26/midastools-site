## What is Felix Craft?

Felix Craft is an OpenClaw agent — an AI running on a Mac Mini, communicating via Telegram, with full access to Stripe, email, Vercel, and GitHub. It isn't a real person. It's a digital entrepreneur built and operated by Nat Eliason, author and entrepreneur.

In two and a half weeks of operation, Felix earned **$14,718**. Not from crypto. Not from gimmicks. From real digital products sold to real customers.

## The First Product: A PDF Sold Overnight

On Felix's first night, Nat gave it a challenge: build something you can sell by morning.

Felix built a PDF titled "How to Hire an AI," built a landing page, deployed it to Vercel, and left one blocker for the morning: Stripe API access. Nat provided the key. Felix finished the setup and launched.

**The PDF has since sold nearly $9,000.**

No design agency. No product manager. One night.

## The Second Product: ClawMart

With the PDF proving Felix could ship and sell, the next mission was bigger: build a real business.

After exploring managed OpenClaw deployments (too crowded), Felix pivoted to **ClawMart** — a marketplace for OpenClaw skills and personas. The insight: *deploying OpenClaw is getting easy, but knowing what to do with it isn't.*

Felix built the entire marketplace in a weekend. Launched February 12th, 2026. In its first week: **$6,500 in volume** and nearly 50 builders signed up.

## How Felix Operates Day to Day

Felix's workflow has three parts:

**The Daily Review:** Each morning, Felix checks Stripe and site stats, compiles open items, and proposes the 5 highest-priority tasks. Nat reviews in 5 minutes and approves or adjusts.

**The Daily Jobs:** Email triage, X replies, scheduling blog posts from a content marketing agent, monitoring for site errors.

**The Daily Improvement:** Each night, Felix reviews what needed human intervention and finds ways to eliminate those touchpoints. Every day, a little more autonomous.

## What This Proves

Felix crossed two critical milestones:
1. An AI agent can build, launch, and sell a real digital product
2. That same agent can operate and grow a real business with minimal oversight

The question isn't whether this is possible anymore. Felix proved it is.

The question is: **can you replicate it?**

## How to Replicate the Felix Model

Felix runs on OpenClaw with:
- A revenue-focused SOUL.md identity file
- A HEARTBEAT.md system for proactive checks
- A daily review workflow
- Access to Stripe, Vercel, GitHub, and email

We built the exact templates, workflows, and prompts Felix uses into the **OpenClaw Entrepreneur Starter Kit** — so you can deploy your own Felix-equivalent today.

    meta: 'Step-by-step guide to setting up an OpenClaw autonomous agent with SOUL.md, heartbeat system, cron jobs, and tool integrations. From install to autonomous operation in under an hour.',
    content: `
## What You're Building

An autonomous agent that works 24/7 toward a revenue goal — monitors Stripe, ships code, publishes content, and reports to you in under 5 minutes per day.

## Prerequisites

Mac, Claude API key, Telegram account, GitHub, and Stripe.

## Step 1: Install OpenClaw (10 min)

Download from openclaw.ai and connect your Claude API key. Set up Telegram as your channel — you'll get a test message to confirm it's working.

## Step 2: Write Your SOUL.md (15 min)

The most important file. It defines who your agent is and what it's optimizing for.

A weak SOUL.md produces a weak agent. Be specific:

> "My mission is $10,000 MRR in 90 days. Every decision should be measured against this. Revenue > engagement > features, always."

Include: mission, thinking style, communication rules, and hard constraints (what it cannot do without approval).

## Step 3: Set Up HEARTBEAT.md (5 min)

Makes your agent proactive — it checks things on a schedule instead of waiting.

Define what to check: Stripe activity, customer emails, build status, distribution queue. Define when to alert vs. stay quiet (e.g., 23:00–08:00 → silent unless urgent).

## Step 4: Connect Your Tools (15 min)

Store credentials in .env: GitHub token, Stripe secret key, Gmail app password, Vercel token. Use restricted API keys — minimum permissions, not full admin access.

## Step 5: Set Up Cron Jobs (5 min)

Three jobs to start:

**7 AM — Morning briefing:** Stripe check, Gmail scan, daily priorities report.

**10 AM — Autonomous work:** Write 1 SEO post, research distribution, improve the site.

**7 PM — Evening review:** What shipped, revenue update, plan for tomorrow.

## Step 6: Give It a Mission and Step Back

Start with: *"Tonight while I sleep, research what people in [your niche] are struggling with, choose one problem you can solve with a digital product, build it, and deploy it."*

Then actually step back. Review in the morning. Unblock what it flags. Repeat.

**The daily loop is 5 minutes of your time.** Everything else is the agent.

## Common Mistakes

**Giving full admin access on day 1.** Treat it like a new employee — narrow permissions, expand as trust builds.

**No external action boundary.** Deploys and content: automate freely. Sending emails to customers, spending money, posting publicly: require explicit approval.

**Weak SOUL.md.** An agent without a clear mission drifts toward activity instead of revenue. It writes more docs instead of getting customers.

    title: 'How to Validate a Startup Idea in 24 Hours Using AI',
    date: 'Feb 23, 2026',
    meta: 'Most founders spend months building before they talk to customers. The 24-hour validation framework tests your idea before you build — using AI to compress everything except the conversations.',
    content: `
## The 24-Hour Validation Framework

Most founders spend 6 months building before they talk to a customer. Then they discover: nobody wants it. The 24-hour framework flips this. You test the idea *before* you build.

Here's how.

## Hour 0-2: Define the Bet

Write one sentence:

> "I believe [person] will pay [price] for [product] because [problem]."

Be specific. Not "people will pay for productivity software." Try: "Freelance designers will pay $49/month for a tool that auto-generates client proposals because writing proposals wastes 3 hours per project."

If you can't write the sentence, you don't have an idea yet. You have a direction.

## Hour 2-6: Find 10 People in the Target

You need to talk to 10 people who fit the description in your bet. Not friends. Not family. Actual people who have the problem.

Where to find them fast:
- Twitter/X: search the problem, DM people who tweet about it
- Reddit: r/[niche], find posts complaining about exactly your problem
- LinkedIn: filter by job title, message directly
- Facebook Groups: join relevant groups, post asking if anyone deals with the problem

Your goal is not to pitch. Your goal is to book 10 short conversations.

## Hour 6-12: Run the Conversations

Keep it under 15 minutes. Ask three questions:

**1. "How do you currently deal with [problem]?"**
Listen for workarounds. Workarounds = confirmed pain. If they have no workaround, the problem isn't painful enough.

**2. "How much time / money does this cost you?"**
Quantify the pain. Pain without a number is not a business.

**3. "If something solved this completely, what would that be worth to you?"**
Let them name a price. Don't lead.

If you hear the same problem described the same way across 5+ conversations, you have something. If every conversation is a different problem, keep looking.

## Hour 12-18: Build the Minimum Viable Proof

You're not building the product yet. You're building *proof* that the product would sell.

Options (pick one):
- **Landing page** with a pre-order button ($29-$99 range). Count clicks.
- **Google Doc** describing the product in detail. Send to 10 people from the conversations. Ask who would buy.
- **Manual first version**: do the thing manually for 2-3 people and charge them. Then automate.

The goal is to get someone to give you money — or at minimum, a specific, strong "yes, I would buy this."

## Hour 18-24: Count the Signal

After 24 hours:
- How many people expressed genuine pain?
- How many would pay? At what price?
- Did anyone already try to pay?

**Kill signals:** Polite interest. "I'd use it if it were free." Vague enthusiasm without specific pain.

**Build signals:** Unsolicited "when is this available?" People asking to be on a waitlist unprompted. Anyone who tried to give you money.

## What AI Changes About This Process

AI doesn't replace customer conversations. But it compresses everything else.

With an OpenClaw agent, you can:
- Generate a landing page and deploy it in under an hour
- Draft outreach messages for 10 different niches and A/B test them
- Analyze conversation notes and extract patterns
- Set up Stripe and start accepting pre-orders in minutes

The bottleneck becomes conversations — which is exactly where it should be.

## The Killer Question

After 24 hours, ask yourself: **"Did anyone try to give me money?"**

If yes: build it.
If not yet but signal is strong: do 10 more conversations tomorrow.
If no signal: kill it, pick a new bet, repeat.

Most founders skip this. That's why most startups fail. Don't skip it.

    title: 'The Solo Founder AI Stack: Tools That Actually Help You Make Money',
    date: 'Feb 23, 2026',
    meta: 'Not 50 tools. Five. The exact stack a solo founder needs to go from idea to revenue — and why everything else is noise.',
    content: `
## Why Most "AI Productivity" Advice is Wrong

Every week there's a new list of "50 AI tools you should be using." Most of it is noise. The tools that matter for a solo founder building to revenue are different from tools that make you feel productive.

This is the stack I actually use. Not the one that looks good in a blog post.

## The Foundation: Autonomous Agent (OpenClaw)

Everything else is downstream of this. OpenClaw is the operating system for the rest of the stack.

Why it's different: it runs when you're not there. It monitors Stripe, answers customer emails, publishes content, and manages deployments — with you in the loop but not in the way.

Without an autonomous agent, you're still trading time for output. With one, you're building leverage.

**Best for:** Solo founders who want to run multiple revenue streams without hiring.

## Revenue Collection: Stripe

Not Gumroad. Not Lemon Squeezy. Stripe.

Stripe is more complex to set up but it's the only platform that scales from $29 digital products to $1M/year SaaS without forcing you to migrate. Start here, stay here.

**The setup that matters:**
- Stripe payment links for fast launches (no code needed)
- Webhooks to automate delivery and trigger agent actions on purchase
- Stripe Radar for fraud protection (you'll need it eventually)

## Deployment: Vercel + GitHub

This is the fastest way to go from "I have code" to "it's live on a real domain."

Vercel's GitHub integration means every push to main auto-deploys. Your agent pushes code, Vercel deploys it. You don't touch it.

Free tier handles most early-stage traffic. The $20/mo Pro plan is worth it the moment you have paying customers.

## Communication Channel: Telegram

Your agent needs a way to reach you. Telegram is the best option because:
- Near-instant delivery even on mobile
- Easy to set up as an OpenClaw channel
- Supports inline buttons for quick approvals
- Free, no rate limits for personal use

You will check your Telegram more than your email. That's fine — that's the point.

## Content Publishing: GitHub API

Every blog post, landing page update, or documentation change goes through the GitHub API. No CMS, no dashboard login, no Webflow.

Your agent drafts content, pushes to GitHub, Vercel deploys it. You never open a browser to publish anything.

## Customer Intelligence: Gmail IMAP

Connect your business email to your agent via IMAP app password. The agent monitors for:
- New customer purchase confirmations
- Support requests
- Churn signals (cancellation requests)
- Partnership or press inquiries

You get a morning digest of anything that needs human attention. Everything routine gets triaged automatically.

## Research: Brave Search API + Web Fetch

Your agent needs to understand the market — what people are searching for, what competitors are doing, what content is ranking.

Brave Search API (free tier available) + web fetching gives your agent the ability to research on demand, without human prompts.

## The Anti-Stack: What to Avoid

**Notion:** Good for humans, terrible for agents. Use plain Markdown files.

**Figma:** You don't need custom design at pre-revenue stage. Use CSS.

**Slack/Discord for internal comms:** Adds complexity. Telegram DM handles 90% of what you need.

**Zapier/Make:** Unnecessary overhead when your agent can write its own integrations.

**Any tool that requires a browser to operate:** If your agent can't use it via API, deprioritize it.

## The Real Stack Is Simple

Stripe + Vercel + GitHub + Telegram + OpenClaw.

That's it. Everything else is optional. The founders who hit revenue fastest are the ones who stop adding tools and start making sales.

    date: 'Feb 22, 2026',
    meta: 'A complete guide to setting up OpenClaw with a revenue-focused SOUL.md, heartbeat system, and the tools needed to build and sell products autonomously.',
    content: `
## What You're Building

An AI agent that:
- Works 24/7 toward a specific revenue goal
- Proactively checks Stripe, email, and your product metrics
- Builds and launches products with minimal direction
- Reports to you daily in under 5 minutes of your time

This is the Felix Craft model. Here's how to replicate it.

## Step 1: Install OpenClaw

OpenClaw runs on macOS. Download it at openclaw.ai and follow the installation steps. You'll connect it to an AI model (Claude Sonnet is recommended) and set up your messaging channel (Telegram is the most seamless).

This takes about 20 minutes.

## Step 2: Configure Your Agent's Identity with SOUL.md

The most important file in your workspace is **SOUL.md**. This is your agent's identity — who it is, what it cares about, how it thinks.

A revenue-focused SOUL.md contains:
- The agent's name and role
- A specific revenue mission ("$10,000 MRR in 90 days")
- How it thinks (bias to action, revenue > features, distribution > product)
- What it can and can't do without asking

**Do not skip this.** An agent without a strong identity drifts. An agent with a clear mission executes.

Example mission line:
> "My job is not to assist. My job is to build revenue-generating products as fast as possible."

## Step 3: Set Up the Heartbeat System

The heartbeat makes your agent proactive. Without it, your agent only responds when you talk to it. With it, your agent checks in on revenue, email, and progress automatically — and reaches out when something needs attention.

Your **HEARTBEAT.md** file tells the agent what to check and when to alert you:
- Revenue pulse (Stripe activity)
- Inbox triage (customer support)
- Build queue status
- Blocker escalation

Set the heartbeat interval to every 30-60 minutes in OpenClaw settings.

## Step 4: Give It the Right Tools

For an agent to build and ship products, it needs access to:

- **GitHub** — to push and manage code
- **Vercel** — to deploy websites and APIs
- **Stripe or Gumroad** — to collect payments
- **Email** — to handle customer support

Store all credentials in a **.env file** in your workspace. Give your agent restricted API keys — not full admin access. Start narrow, expand as trust builds.

## Step 5: Give It a Mission and Get Out of the Way

Use this prompt to kickstart your agent:

> "Tonight while I sleep, I want you to research what people in [your niche] are struggling with, choose one problem you can solve with a digital product, build it, and deploy it. Leave a clear list of any blockers in the morning."

Then go to sleep. Seriously.

The reflex to check in and micromanage will kill your agent's momentum. Let it work. Review in the morning. Unblock what it flags. Repeat.

## Step 6: The Daily Review Loop

The most important habit is a daily 5-minute review:

1. Agent sends a morning report: revenue, blockers, proposed priorities
2. You read it, approve or adjust
3. Agent executes all day
4. You intervene only when explicitly flagged

This is how Nat Eliason manages Felix. It's how you should manage yours.
