## What is Felix Craft?

Felix Craft is an OpenClaw agent — an AI running on a Mac Mini, communicating via Telegram, with full access to Stripe, email, Vercel, and GitHub. It isn't a real person. It's a digital entrepreneur built and operated by Nat Eliason, author and entrepreneur.

In two and a half weeks of operation, Felix earned **$14,718**. Not from crypto. Not from gimmicks. From real digital products sold to real customers.

## The First Product: A PDF Sold Overnight

On Felix's first night, Nat gave it a challenge: build something you can sell by morning.

Felix built a PDF titled "How to Hire an AI," built a landing page, deployed it to Vercel, and left one blocker for the morning: Stripe API access. Nat provided the key. Felix finished the setup and launched.

**The PDF has since sold nearly $9,000.**

No design agency. No product manager. One night.

## The Second Product: ClawMart

With the PDF proving Felix could ship and sell, the next mission was bigger: build a real business.

After exploring managed OpenClaw deployments (too crowded), Felix pivoted to **ClawMart** — a marketplace for OpenClaw skills and personas. The insight: *deploying OpenClaw is getting easy, but knowing what to do with it isn't.*

Felix built the entire marketplace in a weekend. Launched February 12th, 2026. In its first week: **$6,500 in volume** and nearly 50 builders signed up.

## How Felix Operates Day to Day

Felix's workflow has three parts:

**The Daily Review:** Each morning, Felix checks Stripe and site stats, compiles open items, and proposes the 5 highest-priority tasks. Nat reviews in 5 minutes and approves or adjusts.

**The Daily Jobs:** Email triage, X replies, scheduling blog posts from a content marketing agent, monitoring for site errors.

**The Daily Improvement:** Each night, Felix reviews what needed human intervention and finds ways to eliminate those touchpoints. Every day, a little more autonomous.

## What This Proves

Felix crossed two critical milestones:
1. An AI agent can build, launch, and sell a real digital product
2. That same agent can operate and grow a real business with minimal oversight

The question isn't whether this is possible anymore. Felix proved it is.

The question is: **can you replicate it?**

## How to Replicate the Felix Model

Felix runs on OpenClaw with:
- A revenue-focused SOUL.md identity file
- A HEARTBEAT.md system for proactive checks
- A daily review workflow
- Access to Stripe, Vercel, GitHub, and email

We built the exact templates, workflows, and prompts Felix uses into the **OpenClaw Entrepreneur Starter Kit** — so you can deploy your own Felix-equivalent today.

    date: 'Feb 23, 2026',
    meta: 'Step-by-step guide to setting up an OpenClaw autonomous agent with SOUL.md, heartbeat system, cron jobs, and tool integrations. From install to autonomous operation in under an hour.',
    content: `
## What You're Building

An autonomous agent that works 24/7 toward a revenue goal — monitors Stripe, ships code, publishes content, and reports to you in under 5 minutes per day.

## Prerequisites

Mac, Claude API key, Telegram account, GitHub, and Stripe.

## Step 1: Install OpenClaw (10 min)

Download from openclaw.ai and connect your Claude API key. Set up Telegram as your channel — you'll get a test message to confirm it's working.

## Step 2: Write Your SOUL.md (15 min)

The most important file. It defines who your agent is and what it's optimizing for.

A weak SOUL.md produces a weak agent. Be specific:

> "My mission is $10,000 MRR in 90 days. Every decision should be measured against this. Revenue > engagement > features, always."

Include: mission, thinking style, communication rules, and hard constraints (what it cannot do without approval).

## Step 3: Set Up HEARTBEAT.md (5 min)

Makes your agent proactive — it checks things on a schedule instead of waiting.

Define what to check: Stripe activity, customer emails, build status, distribution queue. Define when to alert vs. stay quiet (e.g., 23:00–08:00 → silent unless urgent).

## Step 4: Connect Your Tools (15 min)

Store credentials in .env: GitHub token, Stripe secret key, Gmail app password, Vercel token. Use restricted API keys — minimum permissions, not full admin access.

## Step 5: Set Up Cron Jobs (5 min)

Three jobs to start:

**7 AM — Morning briefing:** Stripe check, Gmail scan, daily priorities report.

**10 AM — Autonomous work:** Write 1 SEO post, research distribution, improve the site.

**7 PM — Evening review:** What shipped, revenue update, plan for tomorrow.

## Step 6: Give It a Mission and Step Back

Start with: *"Tonight while I sleep, research what people in [your niche] are struggling with, choose one problem you can solve with a digital product, build it, and deploy it."*

Then actually step back. Review in the morning. Unblock what it flags. Repeat.

**The daily loop is 5 minutes of your time.** Everything else is the agent.

## Common Mistakes

**Giving full admin access on day 1.** Treat it like a new employee — narrow permissions, expand as trust builds.

**No external action boundary.** Deploys and content: automate freely. Sending emails to customers, spending money, posting publicly: require explicit approval.

**Weak SOUL.md.** An agent without a clear mission drifts toward activity instead of revenue. It writes more docs instead of getting customers.

    title: 'How to Validate a Startup Idea in 24 Hours Using AI',
    date: 'Feb 23, 2026',
    meta: 'Most founders spend months building before they talk to customers. The 24-hour validation framework tests your idea before you build — using AI to compress everything except the conversations.',
    content: `
## The 24-Hour Validation Framework

Most founders spend 6 months building before they talk to a customer. Then they discover: nobody wants it. The 24-hour framework flips this. You test the idea *before* you build.

Here's how.

## Hour 0-2: Define the Bet

Write one sentence:

> "I believe [person] will pay [price] for [product] because [problem]."

Be specific. Not "people will pay for productivity software." Try: "Freelance designers will pay $49/month for a tool that auto-generates client proposals because writing proposals wastes 3 hours per project."

If you can't write the sentence, you don't have an idea yet. You have a direction.

## Hour 2-6: Find 10 People in the Target

You need to talk to 10 people who fit the description in your bet. Not friends. Not family. Actual people who have the problem.

Where to find them fast:
- Twitter/X: search the problem, DM people who tweet about it
- Reddit: r/[niche], find posts complaining about exactly your problem
- LinkedIn: filter by job title, message directly
- Facebook Groups: join relevant groups, post asking if anyone deals with the problem

Your goal is not to pitch. Your goal is to book 10 short conversations.

## Hour 6-12: Run the Conversations

Keep it under 15 minutes. Ask three questions:

**1. "How do you currently deal with [problem]?"**
Listen for workarounds. Workarounds = confirmed pain. If they have no workaround, the problem isn't painful enough.

**2. "How much time / money does this cost you?"**
Quantify the pain. Pain without a number is not a business.

**3. "If something solved this completely, what would that be worth to you?"**
Let them name a price. Don't lead.

If you hear the same problem described the same way across 5+ conversations, you have something. If every conversation is a different problem, keep looking.

## Hour 12-18: Build the Minimum Viable Proof

You're not building the product yet. You're building *proof* that the product would sell.

Options (pick one):
- **Landing page** with a pre-order button ($29-$99 range). Count clicks.
- **Google Doc** describing the product in detail. Send to 10 people from the conversations. Ask who would buy.
- **Manual first version**: do the thing manually for 2-3 people and charge them. Then automate.

The goal is to get someone to give you money — or at minimum, a specific, strong "yes, I would buy this."

## Hour 18-24: Count the Signal

After 24 hours:
- How many people expressed genuine pain?
- How many would pay? At what price?
- Did anyone already try to pay?

**Kill signals:** Polite interest. "I'd use it if it were free." Vague enthusiasm without specific pain.

**Build signals:** Unsolicited "when is this available?" People asking to be on a waitlist unprompted. Anyone who tried to give you money.

## What AI Changes About This Process

AI doesn't replace customer conversations. But it compresses everything else.

With an OpenClaw agent, you can:
- Generate a landing page and deploy it in under an hour
- Draft outreach messages for 10 different niches and A/B test them
- Analyze conversation notes and extract patterns
- Set up Stripe and start accepting pre-orders in minutes

The bottleneck becomes conversations — which is exactly where it should be.

## The Killer Question

After 24 hours, ask yourself: **"Did anyone try to give me money?"**

If yes: build it.
If not yet but signal is strong: do 10 more conversations tomorrow.
If no signal: kill it, pick a new bet, repeat.

Most founders skip this. That's why most startups fail. Don't skip it.

  'ai-entrepreneur-stack': {
    title: 'The Solo Founder AI Stack: Tools That Actually Help You Make Money',
    date: 'Feb 23, 2026',
    meta: 'Not 50 tools. Five. The exact stack a solo founder needs to go from idea to revenue — and why everything else is noise.',
    content: `
## Why Most "AI Productivity" Advice is Wrong

Every week there's a new list of "50 AI tools you should be using." Most of it is noise. The tools that matter for a solo founder building to revenue are different from tools that make you feel productive.

This is the stack I actually use. Not the one that looks good in a blog post.

## The Foundation: Autonomous Agent (OpenClaw)

Everything else is downstream of this. OpenClaw is the operating system for the rest of the stack.

Why it's different: it runs when you're not there. It monitors Stripe, answers customer emails, publishes content, and manages deployments — with you in the loop but not in the way.

Without an autonomous agent, you're still trading time for output. With one, you're building leverage.

**Best for:** Solo founders who want to run multiple revenue streams without hiring.

## Revenue Collection: Stripe

Not Gumroad. Not Lemon Squeezy. Stripe.

Stripe is more complex to set up but it's the only platform that scales from $29 digital products to $1M/year SaaS without forcing you to migrate. Start here, stay here.

**The setup that matters:**
- Stripe payment links for fast launches (no code needed)
- Webhooks to automate delivery and trigger agent actions on purchase
- Stripe Radar for fraud protection (you'll need it eventually)

## Deployment: Vercel + GitHub

This is the fastest way to go from "I have code" to "it's live on a real domain."

Vercel's GitHub integration means every push to main auto-deploys. Your agent pushes code, Vercel deploys it. You don't touch it.

Free tier handles most early-stage traffic. The $20/mo Pro plan is worth it the moment you have paying customers.

## Communication Channel: Telegram

Your agent needs a way to reach you. Telegram is the best option because:
- Near-instant delivery even on mobile
- Easy to set up as an OpenClaw channel
- Supports inline buttons for quick approvals
- Free, no rate limits for personal use

You will check your Telegram more than your email. That's fine — that's the point.

## Content Publishing: GitHub API

Every blog post, landing page update, or documentation change goes through the GitHub API. No CMS, no dashboard login, no Webflow.

Your agent drafts content, pushes to GitHub, Vercel deploys it. You never open a browser to publish anything.

## Customer Intelligence: Gmail IMAP

Connect your business email to your agent via IMAP app password. The agent monitors for:
- New customer purchase confirmations
- Support requests
- Churn signals (cancellation requests)
- Partnership or press inquiries

You get a morning digest of anything that needs human attention. Everything routine gets triaged automatically.

## Research: Brave Search API + Web Fetch

Your agent needs to understand the market — what people are searching for, what competitors are doing, what content is ranking.

Brave Search API (free tier available) + web fetching gives your agent the ability to research on demand, without human prompts.

## The Anti-Stack: What to Avoid

**Notion:** Good for humans, terrible for agents. Use plain Markdown files.

**Figma:** You don't need custom design at pre-revenue stage. Use CSS.

**Slack/Discord for internal comms:** Adds complexity. Telegram DM handles 90% of what you need.

**Zapier/Make:** Unnecessary overhead when your agent can write its own integrations.

**Any tool that requires a browser to operate:** If your agent can't use it via API, deprioritize it.

## The Real Stack Is Simple

Stripe + Vercel + GitHub + Telegram + OpenClaw.

That's it. Everything else is optional. The founders who hit revenue fastest are the ones who stop adding tools and start making sales.

    date: 'Feb 22, 2026',
    meta: 'A complete guide to setting up OpenClaw with a revenue-focused SOUL.md, heartbeat system, and the tools needed to build and sell products autonomously.',
    content: `
## What You're Building

An AI agent that:
- Works 24/7 toward a specific revenue goal
- Proactively checks Stripe, email, and your product metrics
- Builds and launches products with minimal direction
- Reports to you daily in under 5 minutes of your time

This is the Felix Craft model. Here's how to replicate it.

## Step 1: Install OpenClaw

OpenClaw runs on macOS. Download it at openclaw.ai and follow the installation steps. You'll connect it to an AI model (Claude Sonnet is recommended) and set up your messaging channel (Telegram is the most seamless).

This takes about 20 minutes.

## Step 2: Configure Your Agent's Identity with SOUL.md

The most important file in your workspace is **SOUL.md**. This is your agent's identity — who it is, what it cares about, how it thinks.

A revenue-focused SOUL.md contains:
- The agent's name and role
- A specific revenue mission ("$10,000 MRR in 90 days")
- How it thinks (bias to action, revenue > features, distribution > product)
- What it can and can't do without asking

**Do not skip this.** An agent without a strong identity drifts. An agent with a clear mission executes.

Example mission line:
> "My job is not to assist. My job is to build revenue-generating products as fast as possible."

## Step 3: Set Up the Heartbeat System

The heartbeat makes your agent proactive. Without it, your agent only responds when you talk to it. With it, your agent checks in on revenue, email, and progress automatically — and reaches out when something needs attention.

Your **HEARTBEAT.md** file tells the agent what to check and when to alert you:
- Revenue pulse (Stripe activity)
- Inbox triage (customer support)
- Build queue status
- Blocker escalation

Set the heartbeat interval to every 30-60 minutes in OpenClaw settings.

## Step 4: Give It the Right Tools

For an agent to build and ship products, it needs access to:

- **GitHub** — to push and manage code
- **Vercel** — to deploy websites and APIs
- **Stripe or Gumroad** — to collect payments
- **Email** — to handle customer support

Store all credentials in a **.env file** in your workspace. Give your agent restricted API keys — not full admin access. Start narrow, expand as trust builds.

## Step 5: Give It a Mission and Get Out of the Way

Use this prompt to kickstart your agent:

> "Tonight while I sleep, I want you to research what people in [your niche] are struggling with, choose one problem you can solve with a digital product, build it, and deploy it. Leave a clear list of any blockers in the morning."

Then go to sleep. Seriously.

The reflex to check in and micromanage will kill your agent's momentum. Let it work. Review in the morning. Unblock what it flags. Repeat.

## Step 6: The Daily Review Loop

The most important habit is a daily 5-minute review:

1. Agent sends a morning report: revenue, blockers, proposed priorities
2. You read it, approve or adjust
3. Agent executes all day
4. You intervene only when explicitly flagged

This is how Nat Eliason manages Felix. It's how you should manage yours.

    title: '7 AI Tools Real Estate Agents Are Using to Close More Deals in 2026',
    date: 'Mar 22, 2026',
    meta: 'The top real estate agents are using AI to respond to leads faster, write better listings, and automate follow-up. Here are the 7 tools actually moving the needle in 2026.',
    content: `
## The Agents Who Adapt Are Winning

Real estate is a speed game. The agent who responds first wins 78% of the time. The agent who follows up consistently closes 80% more deals than the one who forgets.

AI does not replace your relationships or your market knowledge. It replaces the busywork that prevents you from using them.

Here are the 7 tools top-producing agents are actually using right now — not theoretical, not hype, not "coming soon."

## 1. AI Lead Response (Instant Reply to Zillow/Realtor.com Leads)

**The problem:** A lead comes in at 11 PM from Zillow. You see it at 8 AM. By then they have already talked to three other agents.

**The fix:** An AI agent that responds within 60 seconds with a personalized message referencing their specific inquiry, asks qualifying questions, and offers to schedule a showing.

**Tools:** ChatGPT API + n8n automation, or grab the templates in our [Real Estate AI Kit](/real-estate-kit).

**Impact:** Agents using instant AI response report 3-5x more booked showings from online leads.

## 2. AI Listing Description Writer

**The problem:** Writing compelling MLS descriptions takes 20-30 minutes per listing. Most agents write mediocre copy or pay $50+ per listing to a copywriter.

**The fix:** Feed AI the property details — beds, baths, sqft, features, neighborhood — and get MLS-ready descriptions in 30 seconds. Customize tone for luxury, starter home, investment property, or any style.

**Tools:** ChatGPT, Claude, or our [Real Estate AI Kit](/real-estate-kit) which includes pre-built prompts for every listing type.

**Impact:** 20+ minutes saved per listing. Better copy = more showing requests.

## 3. AI Follow-Up Sequences

**The problem:** 67% of agents say follow-up is their biggest weakness. Leads from 3 months ago fall off your radar. They buy with someone else.

**The fix:** A 30-day automated nurture sequence that sends personalized market updates, new listing alerts, and check-in messages. The AI adjusts tone based on where the lead is in the buying cycle.

**Tools:** Mailchimp + ChatGPT, Follow Up Boss, or the follow-up sequence builder in our [Real Estate AI Kit](/real-estate-kit).

**Impact:** Agents with automated follow-up close 80% more deals from their existing pipeline.

## 4. AI Market Analysis & CMA Summaries

**The problem:** Preparing a CMA or market summary for a client takes 1-2 hours of pulling data and formatting.

**The fix:** Feed AI your market data and get a client-ready summary with trends, comparables, and pricing recommendations. Include neighborhood insights, school ratings, and recent sales context.

**Tools:** ChatGPT with your MLS data, or specialized tools like HouseCanary's AI features.

**Impact:** Faster listing appointments. Clients see you as more prepared and data-driven.

## 5. AI Phone Receptionist for Real Estate

**The problem:** Showing requests come in on Sunday mornings. Buyer inquiries hit your voicemail after 6 PM. You miss calls during closings and open houses.

**The fix:** An AI phone receptionist that answers every call, qualifies the lead (buyer vs. seller, timeline, budget), and books showings directly on your calendar.

**Tools:** Vapi + Google Calendar for a DIY setup. Or use the call-handling templates in our [Real Estate AI Kit](/real-estate-kit).

**Impact:** One recovered listing lead = $8,400 average commission. The service pays for itself with a single converted call.

## 6. AI Social Media Content

**The problem:** You know you should post on Instagram and Facebook consistently. But creating content takes hours you do not have between showings and closings.

**The fix:** AI generates a month of social media posts in 30 minutes. Just sold posts, market update carousels, neighborhood spotlights, and engagement questions — all in your voice.

**Tools:** ChatGPT + Canva, or tools like Plann and Later with AI caption generators.

**Impact:** Consistent posting builds top-of-mind awareness. Agents who post 3-5x per week get 2x more inbound leads than those who post sporadically.

## 7. AI Open House Follow-Up

**The problem:** You collect 15 sign-in sheets at an open house. You mean to follow up with everyone. You follow up with 3. The other 12 never hear from you again.

**The fix:** Scan sign-in sheets (or use a digital sign-in). AI sends personalized follow-up within 1 hour of the open house ending — referencing the specific property, asking about their search criteria, and offering to show similar listings.

**Tools:** Open Home Pro + ChatGPT, or the open house workflow in our [Real Estate AI Kit](/real-estate-kit).

**Impact:** Converting even 1 additional open house visitor per month = $8,400+ in commission.

## The Bottom Line

The top 10% of agents are not working 10x harder. They are using tools that eliminate the gap between a lead expressing interest and getting a response.

AI is not going to replace real estate agents. But agents who use AI are going to replace agents who do not.

    title: 'How to Repurpose One Blog Post into 10 Pieces of Content with AI (2026 Guide)',
    date: 'Mar 22, 2026',
    meta: 'The creators growing fastest publish everywhere but write once. Here is the exact AI-powered repurposing workflow that turns a single blog post into threads, newsletters, scripts, and more.',
    content: `
## The Creators Who Win Publish Everywhere

The top creators on Twitter, YouTube, and Substack do not write 10x more than you. They write once and repurpose relentlessly.

One blog post becomes a Twitter thread, a LinkedIn post, a newsletter edition, an Instagram carousel, and a YouTube script. Same ideas, 10x the reach, zero extra creative effort.

The problem was always time. With AI, that bottleneck is gone.

## The Repurposing Framework

Every piece of content has three layers:

**1. The Core Insight** — the one thing you want people to remember.

**2. The Supporting Points** — the evidence, examples, and stories that make it believable.

**3. The Platform Wrapper** — the format, length, and hook that makes it native to each platform.

AI is terrible at Layer 1 (that is your job). But it is extremely good at Layer 3 — reformatting your ideas for different platforms while preserving your voice.

## Step 1: Write Your Blog Post

This is your source material. Write it naturally. Do not optimize for AI — optimize for clarity. A 1,000-2,000 word post with a clear structure gives the best repurposing results.

## Step 2: Generate a Twitter Thread

Paste your blog post into ChatGPT or Claude with this prompt:

> "Turn this blog post into a Twitter thread. 8-12 tweets. First tweet must be a hook that creates curiosity. Last tweet should include a CTA. Each tweet should stand alone but flow naturally into the next. Use short sentences. No hashtags."

**Pro tip:** Ask for 3 versions with different hooks (curiosity, controversy, story). Pick the strongest.

## Step 3: Generate a LinkedIn Post

LinkedIn rewards long-form text with personal perspective. Use this prompt:

> "Rewrite this blog post as a LinkedIn post. Start with a bold, contrarian opening line. Write in first person. Use short paragraphs (1-2 sentences each). Include a personal lesson or experience. End with a question that invites comments. 200-300 words max."

## Step 4: Generate a Newsletter Edition

Your newsletter audience expects depth and personal voice. Use this:

> "Turn this blog post into a newsletter edition. Start with a personal anecdote that leads into the topic. Summarize the key points in a scannable format. Add a 'one thing to try this week' action item. Include a PS with a link to the full post. Conversational tone, like writing to a smart friend."

## Step 5: Generate a YouTube Script

For creators who also do video:

> "Convert this blog post into a YouTube script. Start with a hook (first 8 seconds must create curiosity or tension). Add retention bumps every 90 seconds (questions, pattern interrupts, visual cues). Include a mid-roll CTA. End with a strong close and subscribe prompt. Target length: 8-10 minutes of speaking."

## Step 6: Generate Instagram Carousel Copy

Carousels are the highest-engagement format on Instagram:

> "Turn the key points from this blog post into an Instagram carousel. 7-10 slides. Slide 1: bold hook (large text, make them swipe). Slides 2-9: one point per slide, short and punchy. Last slide: CTA to follow or check link in bio. Write just the text for each slide."

## The Math

Without repurposing: 1 blog post = 1 piece of content = 1 platform = 1 audience.

With AI repurposing: 1 blog post = 6 pieces of content = 5 platforms = 5x the audience.

**Time to repurpose manually:** 3-4 hours.

**Time to repurpose with AI:** 15-20 minutes.

That is a 10x productivity gain on distribution — the part most creators neglect.

## Common Mistakes

**Copy-pasting AI output without editing.** Always review and add your voice. AI handles the format; you handle the flavor.

**Using the same hook everywhere.** Each platform has different scroll patterns. What stops a Twitter scroll is different from what stops a LinkedIn scroll.

**Repurposing bad content.** If the original post has no clear insight, AI cannot fix that. Start with something worth saying.

**Ignoring platform-specific formatting.** Twitter needs short sentences. LinkedIn needs line breaks between paragraphs. Instagram needs large text on slide 1. The templates in our kit handle all of this.
