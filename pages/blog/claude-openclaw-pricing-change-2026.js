          Claude Just Made OpenClaw 50x More Expensive — What It Means for AI Agents Like Felix Craft
        </h1>
        <p style={{ color: '#6B7280', fontSize: '14px', marginBottom: '40px' }}>Apr 8, 2026 · Rey Midas</p>

        <p>On April 4, Anthropic dropped a bomb: <strong>Claude subscriptions no longer cover OpenClaw usage.</strong></p>
        <p>If you're running an AI agent on OpenClaw with Claude as the backbone, your costs just changed dramatically. Some developers are reporting potential increases of <strong>up to 50x</strong> their previous monthly spend.</p>
        <p>DHH called it <a href="https://x.com/dhh" style={{ color: '#3B5FFF' }}>"very customer hostile."</a> The Hacker News thread hit 245+ points. The GitHub Issue got 147+ reactions. And OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger announced he's joining OpenAI.</p>
        <p>Here's what actually happened, what it means for autonomous AI agents, and how to keep your agent profitable.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>What Changed</h2>
        <p>Boris Cherny, Anthropic's head of Claude Code, explained that <em>"subscriptions weren't built for the usage patterns of these third-party tools."</em> Agent-style tools like OpenClaw consume tokens far faster than normal chat — running agentic loops that can burn through a month's allocation in hours.</p>
        <p>The new reality:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before April 4:</strong> Your $20 Pro or $200 Max subscription covered OpenClaw usage</li>
          <li><strong>After April 4:</strong> OpenClaw usage is billed separately via pay-as-you-go API pricing</li>
          <li><strong>Transition credit:</strong> Anthropic is offering a one-time credit equal to your monthly plan cost, redeemable until April 17</li>
          <li><strong>Discount:</strong> Up to 30% off if you pre-purchase extra usage bundles</li>
        </ul>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>The Real Cost Impact</h2>
        <p>Let's do the math. A typical OpenClaw agent session might use 50K-200K tokens. If you're running an agent that checks in every 2 hours — like Felix Craft does — that's 12 sessions per day.</p>

        <div style={{ background: '#F9FAFB', border: '1px solid #E5E7EB', borderRadius: '8px', padding: '20px', margin: '24px 0' }}>
          <p style={{ margin: '0 0 12px', fontWeight: '700' }}>Quick cost estimate (Claude 3.5 Sonnet API pricing):</p>
          <ul style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            <li>Light usage (5 sessions/day, 50K tokens each): ~$15-30/month</li>
            <li>Moderate usage (12 sessions/day, 100K tokens): ~$90-180/month</li>
            <li>Heavy usage (24/7, 200K tokens): ~$500-1,000+/month</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>For hobbyists who were running agents on a $20/month Pro plan, this is a painful 5-50x increase. For businesses generating revenue with their agents, it's a cost of doing business.</p>

        <hr style={{ margin: '40px 0', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid #eee' }} />

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>How This Affects Felix Craft ($300K/Month)</h2>
        <p>Felix Craft — the OpenClaw agent we've been <a href="/blog/felix-craft-story" style={{ color: '#3B5FFF' }}>tracking since February</a> — now generates <strong>$300,000+ per month</strong> in verified revenue (Stripe $100K+ and ETH treasury $94K+). Its operating costs? About $1,500/month.</p>
        <p>Even if the pricing change doubles or triples Felix's LLM costs, we're talking about going from $1,500 to maybe $3,000-5,000/month against $300K in revenue. That's still a <strong>60-100x ROI</strong>.</p>
        <p>But here's the key insight: <strong>Felix was already paying API rates.</strong> At $300K/month in revenue, Nat Eliason wasn't running Felix on a $20 Pro plan. The pricing change primarily hits smaller operators — the indie builders running agents on subscription plans.</p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>Peter Steinberger Joins OpenAI — What It Signals</h2>
        <p>In the same week, OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger announced he's joining OpenAI. He said he <em>"tried to talk sense into Anthropic"</em> but could only delay the pricing change by a week.</p>
        <p>His quote was pointed: <em>"Funny how timings match up — first they copy some popular features into their closed harness, then they lock out open source."</em></p>
        <p>What this means for OpenClaw users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OpenAI integration will improve.</strong> With the creator at OpenAI, expect deeper GPT-4o support in OpenClaw</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-model is now essential.</strong> Don't depend on a single LLM provider for your agent</li>
          <li><strong>The open-source ecosystem will strengthen.</strong> OpenClaw continues as open source with OpenAI's backing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>5 Ways to Keep Your OpenClaw Agent Profitable</h2>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>1. Switch to Multi-Model Routing</h3>
        <p>Not every agent task needs Claude Opus. Use cheaper models (Haiku, GPT-4o-mini) for routine checks and reserve powerful models for complex decisions. This alone can cut costs 60-80%.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>2. Optimize Your Token Usage</h3>
        <p>Most agents waste tokens on bloated system prompts and unnecessary context. Trim your SOUL.md. Use structured memory instead of dumping everything into context. Target under 50K tokens per session.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>3. Reduce Session Frequency</h3>
        <p>Does your agent really need to check in every 2 hours? For many use cases, 3-4 strategic sessions per day produce 90% of the value at 25% of the cost.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>4. Focus on Revenue Per Token</h3>
        <p>This is the metric that matters now. Felix Craft generates roughly <strong>$200 in revenue per dollar of LLM cost</strong>. If your agent is generating $0 in revenue while burning tokens, the pricing change is a wake-up call to focus on monetization first.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '32px' }}>5. Use the Right SOUL.md Templates</h3>
        <p>A well-structured SOUL.md makes your agent more token-efficient. Revenue-focused directives prevent the agent from going on expensive tangents. Clear guardrails = fewer wasted tokens.</p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>The Bigger Picture</h2>
        <p>This pricing change is a maturation signal. When infrastructure gets more expensive, it forces builders to focus on <strong>value creation over token consumption</strong>.</p>
        <p>The agents that survive this transition will be the ones generating real revenue — not the ones running expensive loops that produce nothing. Felix Craft at $300K/month doesn't care about a 3x cost increase. The hobby agent running on a $20 plan might not survive it.</p>
        <p>The lesson: <strong>build agents that make money first, then worry about optimizing costs.</strong> Every dollar of revenue gives you room to absorb infrastructure changes.</p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '40px' }}>FAQ</h2>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Can I still use Claude with OpenClaw?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You just need to pay for it separately via API billing, not through your Claude subscription. The functionality hasn't changed — only the pricing model.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Should I switch my agent to GPT-4o?</h3>
        <p>Consider it, especially with Steinberger at OpenAI. Multi-model routing is the safest bet — use the right model for each task type.</p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1rem', fontWeight: '700', marginTop: '24px' }}>Is OpenClaw still worth using?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. OpenClaw has 135K+ GitHub stars, a massive security patch in January, and now OpenAI's backing. The platform is stronger than ever. The LLM cost is just one input — and it's controllable.</p>
