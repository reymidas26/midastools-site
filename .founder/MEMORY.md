- All hero CTAs use `href={STRIPE_URL}` not `href="#buy"`

## Decisions Made
- **2026-03-22**: Founder directive — build a product machine. Research trending, build fast, sell everywhere.
- **2026-03-22**: Product strategy = niche AI kits at $39-49, then bundle at $97
- **2026-03-22**: Homepage product ladder changed: $29 Starter → $97 Bundle → $299 DFY (replaced Pro subscription as middle tier)
- **2026-03-22**: All blog CTAs updated to promote bundle ($97) instead of individual kit ($29) — higher AOV play
- **2026-03-22**: Added competitive comparison table to receptionist page to justify premium pricing
- **2026-03-22**: MAJOR: Professional trust upgrade — shared Layout component (nav+footer), removed emoji logo → "MIDAS·TOOLS" text mark, consistent nav across all 23 pages, professional 4-column footer with product/service/company links, removed "Built by an AI" footer text, cleaned up gimmicky badges, standardized contact email to iam@armando.mx
- **2026-03-22 (S5)**: Freelancer Kit chosen over AI Prompt Pack or Small Biz Kit — 77% freelancer AI adoption + universal pain points (proposals, invoicing, scope creep) + $47 avg Gumroad price matches our $39
- **2026-03-22 (S5)**: Bundle now 4 kits ($156 value → $97) — stronger value prop, 38% savings vs individual
- **2026-03-22 (S9)**: CTA conversion fix — all hero CTAs now go direct to Stripe (was href="#buy" scrolling to section). Founder mandate: every page optimized for conversion, 1 click to buy.
- **2026-03-22 (S9)**: Built ALL 4 kit ZIPs with real content (10,838 lines). Products are now deliverable.
- **2026-03-22 (S9)**: Webhook now routes downloads by product — detects kit type via metadata, payment link ID, product name, or amount
- **2026-03-22 (S9)**: Thank-you page is dynamic — shows correct kit + download link based on ?kit= query param. Bundle shows all 5 downloads.
- **2026-03-22 (S10)**: AI Prompt Mega Pack ($29) shipped — 200+ prompts, 3,331 lines, 6 categories. Broadest appeal product, lowest price entry point.
- **2026-03-22 (S10)**: Bundle upgraded to 6 products (now includes Mega Pack). Value anchor $195 → $224. 57% savings.
- **2026-03-22 (S10)**: Mega Pack added to kits catalog (first position), nav, footer, bundle page, thank-you routing, and webhook delivery.
- **2026-03-23 (S13)**: FULL SITE REBRAND — dark gold/black → clean white + electric blue (#3B5FFF). 30 files updated. Inspired by Future Founders reference. Pill buttons, colorful card accents, dark CTA sections. Pushed to main, Vercel deploying.

## What Worked
- Felix Craft case study is strongest social proof ($14,718 in 3 weeks)
- Receptionist page has full SEO (JSON-LD, FAQ schema, meta tags) — good template for new pages
- Bundle cross-linking from individual kit pages creates natural upsell path
- Before/after comparisons on kit pages make the value proposition concrete

## What Failed
(Nothing yet — Day 0)

## Important Context
- Environment vars needed: GMAIL_ADDRESS, GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID
- **Shared Layout**: `components/Layout.js` — nav, footer, global styles. All pages use it now.
- Logo: "MIDAS·TOOLS" text mark (blue accent + dark text). No emoji.
- **Design System (Session 13 rebrand)**: White bg (#FFF), blue accent (#3B5FFF), dark text (#111827). CSS vars remapped: --gold→blue, --black→white, --white→dark. New vars: --accent, --bg, --text, --text-secondary, --text-tertiary, --border, --surface, --card-green/blue/purple/amber/pink/cyan.
- Fonts loaded globally from _document.js (no longer per-page)
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts), weights 400-900
- Mobile breakpoint: max-width 600px or 700px
- Blog has mix of hosted posts and external links (dev.to, Medium)
- Stripe checkout URLs defined as STRIPE_URL constant at top of each page file
- All 6 Stripe products exist + Mega Pack needs to be created. Founder needs to set success URLs to /thank-you?kit=<type>
- **AI Prompt Mega Pack**: Uses PLACEHOLDER_PROMPT_MEGA_PACK in pages/ai-prompt-mega-pack.js and pages/kits.js — founder must create Stripe product and replace
- Kit content lives in kit-content/ dir, ZIPs in public/. Use .founder/tools/build-kits.sh to rebuild ZIPs.
- Webhook routing: stripe-webhook.js detects kit type via session.metadata.kit_type → payment_link → product_name → amount
- External blog posts (dev.to) cannot be edited for internal links
- Contact email standardized to iam@armando.mx across all pages
