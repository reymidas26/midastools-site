Anthropic shipped **Claude Opus 4.7** on April 16, 2026. Nine days later I'd built 14 production prompts on it and switched between Opus, **GPT-5.4 Pro**, and **Gemini 3.1 Ultra** for every one of them.

Here's the uncomfortable finding: **none of the three wins everything.** The "best model" question is the wrong question. The right question is *for what task*.

Below are 6 real tasks I run weekly. I'll show you the model I pick, why I pick it, and what breaks when I pick wrong.

---

## Quick reference

| Task shape | My pick | Runner-up | Avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| Long-doc synthesis (100+ pages) | **Opus 4.7** | Gemini 3.1 (1M ctx) | GPT-5.4 (32k working memory) |
| Code review with refactor proposal | **Opus 4.7** | GPT-5.4 | Gemini 3.1 (over-explains) |
| Fast comparison with fresh web data | **Gemini 3.1** | GPT-5.4 (Browse) | Opus 4.7 (no browsing) |
| Voice + tool density | **GPT-5.4** | none close | Opus / Gemini |
| Bulk writing under 800 words | **Sonnet 4.5** | GPT-5.4 mini | Opus (overpriced for this) |
| Agent harness with self-verification | **Opus 4.7** | GPT-5.4 | Gemini (compliant, not self-correcting) |

The one rule I trust: **if your prompt fits on one screen and the output is under 800 words, never pay for Opus.** Sonnet ties or wins. Use Opus when the job has *one* of: deep reasoning, 150k+ context, or tool use that needs verification.

---

## Task 1 — Long-document synthesis (100+ pages)

### Winner: Opus 4.7

The job: a 60-page 10-K or whitepaper, and I need to walk away with the *thesis*, the *contradictions*, and the *unstated implications* — not a summary.

```
You are a senior research analyst. Synthesize this 100+ page document for a founder.

Document: "[PASTE FULL TEXT]"

Output:
1. Thesis in ONE sentence (the author's, not mine)
2. 5 claims the author actually makes, with page cites
3. 3 claims the author IMPLIES but never states — and whether evidence holds
4. The 2 places where the document contradicts itself (cite both)
5. 3 questions this document doesn't answer

Rules:
- If a cite is missing, SAY "no cite found" — never fabricate.
- Flag any claim where confidence <70% with [LOW CONFIDENCE].
```

**Why Opus wins:** the "contradicts itself" and "implies but never states" slots force the model to read *against* the text. Gemini 3.1 has the longest context (1M tokens), but on this prompt it summarized obediently — it didn't *interrogate*. GPT-5.4 lost the thread past page 40.

**When Gemini wins instead:** if your doc is over 200k tokens, Opus rejects it. Gemini 3.1's 1M context is the only path. Accept the slightly weaker reasoning.

---

## Task 2 — Code review with refactor proposal

### Winner: Opus 4.7

The job: paste a 300-line file. Get back a review that names the worst smell, proposes a refactor, and writes the diff with self-review.

```
You are a senior staff engineer. Review this file with NO sycophancy.

[PASTE FILE]

Output:
- Worst code smell, with line number and explanation
- Refactor proposal (architecture, not nits)
- Diff in unified format
- Self-review: 3 things your own diff might break in production
- 1 question you'd ask the author before merging
```

**Why Opus wins:** the self-review slot. Opus 4.7 will write a refactor and then *attack it*. GPT-5.4 writes the refactor and stops. Gemini 3.1 writes a refactor with a long preamble I have to scroll past.

**When GPT-5.4 wins instead:** if you're inside Cursor/Copilot and you want the change *applied* directly, GPT-5.4's tool integration is unbeaten. Opus is for review; GPT for execution.

---

## Task 3 — Fast comparison with fresh web data

### Winner: Gemini 3.1 Ultra

The job: "Compare the top 5 [X] tools as of this week." Anything time-sensitive.

```
You are a product analyst. Compare the top 5 [CATEGORY] tools as of [TODAY].

For each tool:
- Pricing (current, with date checked)
- One concrete strength a competitor lacks
- One concrete weakness
- Best fit ICP

Cite the source URL for every pricing claim.
```

**Why Gemini wins:** native, real, current browsing. GPT-5.4's Browse mode works but is slower and limits source count. Opus 4.7 has no browsing — it'll make up pricing from training data and you'll embarrass yourself in a board meeting.

This is the one task where the answer is *not* Opus.

---

## Task 4 — Voice agent or heavy tool density

### Winner: GPT-5.4 Pro

The job: real-time voice, function calling against 8+ tools, low-latency back-and-forth.

GPT-5.4's voice mode and Realtime API have no real competition. Opus has voice in the API but the latency penalty is brutal. Gemini has voice through Google AI Studio but the tool ecosystem is thinner.

If you're building a voice agent in 2026, default to GPT-5.4 unless you have a strong reason not to.

---

## Task 5 — Bulk writing under 800 words

### Winner: Claude 4.5 Sonnet (not in this comparison, but it ties Opus)

I won't waste your scroll: **don't pay Opus prices for short writing.** Sonnet 4.5 wins on cost-per-quality, and on 80% of short-form prose tasks it's indistinguishable from Opus blind.

Opus 4.7 only earns its premium when the job has long context, deep reasoning, or self-verification. None apply to a 600-word blog intro.

---

## Task 6 — Agent harness with self-verification

### Winner: Opus 4.7

The job: an agent that runs autonomously for 20+ steps, has to back off when uncertain, and produces a final report with citations.

```
You are an autonomous research agent.

Goal: [GOAL]
Tools available: [LIST]
Budget: 20 steps max

After each step:
- State what you learned
- State your confidence (0-100)
- If confidence <70, narrow scope and try again before continuing
- If confidence >70, proceed

Final report must include:
- Findings (with cites)
- 2 places you might be wrong
- The single question whose answer would most change the conclusion
```

**Why Opus wins:** GPT-5.4 will execute. Gemini 3.1 will execute. Opus will execute, *and then push back on its own conclusion*. If "confidence calibration" matters in your application — research, due diligence, code review, anything reversible-but-expensive — Opus is the only model I trust unsupervised.

---

## The honest summary

If you can only pick one model in 2026:
- **Builder writing code** → Opus 4.7
- **Operator doing research** → Opus 4.7
- **Real-time voice / tool-heavy** → GPT-5.4 Pro
- **Web-grounded comparisons** → Gemini 3.1
- **Anyone optimizing cost** → Sonnet 4.5

Most teams should run **two**: Opus for deep work, GPT-5.4 for execution. Skip the "best model" debate. The interesting question is which model you reach for at 2pm on a Tuesday for the *specific* task in front of you.
