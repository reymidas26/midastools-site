# State

## Current Status (auto-synced from database)

**Bottleneck**: acquisition (severity 6/10) — Upper funnel finally flowing: 1,820 Google imp/mo across 10+ pages + **12 UTM-tagged gists live** (gist #12 AI SaaS Founder Prompts shipped Apr 22 evening, first gist funneling to /saas-founder-kit $39). New narrow point is SERP-to-click at 0.3% CTR (vs industry ~1.5% for pos 13). Top-5 page titles retitled Apr 20 (commit 07c5ab5). Gist pace = 2 in one day (Apr 22). If any lever lands by Apr 24, severity drops to 5. If all three (CTR, DFY replies, gist referrers) flat, escalate to 7 and paid distribution.

**KPIs**:
- Conversations: 0 (target: 10, 7d: 0%)
- Users: 23 (target: 50, 7d: 0%)
- Revenue: 0 (target: 97, 7d: 0%)

## Session 129 (Apr 22, ~19:40 local) — GIST #12 SHIPPED: AI SAAS FOUNDER PROMPTS

### ✅ Gist #12 published: AI SaaS Founder Prompts cheatsheet
- 14 copy-paste templates covering: user research synthesis, landing hero copy, feature→benefit translation, investor update (MRR edition), market size slide, traction narrative, roadmap prioritizer (RICE + override), changelog→release notes, churn diagnostic from cancel replies, pricing experiment framer, cold outreach to first 100 ICP, 7-email onboarding sequence, founder brain-dump→hiring JD, competitor teardown
- **First gist to funnel to /saas-founder-kit ($39)** — diversifies revenue paths from prior image/resume/email-heavy portfolio
- 5-slot universal SaaS prompt formula, model-recommendation table (Claude 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek V3.1), Common Mistakes (5 items), Resources section per playbook
- Also links sister gist #11 (email) for portfolio cross-discovery
- UTM-tagged (10 links), IndexNow-submitted
- Live: https://gist.github.com/manduks/bc445120f5588d30c71c896f0210b00d (HTTP 200 verified)

### Rationale for shipping blind (no referrer data yet)
- Referrer data ask is 5+ days pending; waiting another 2 days to Apr 24 means zero compounding
- SaaS founder audience = high-intent B2B buyers (they literally buy tools for a living)
- /saas-founder-kit had ZERO gists feeding it previously — portfolio concentration risk reduction
- Matches Sequoia "next $1T company" thesis (Session 106) — SaaS founder pain is evergreen
- Playbook `gist-topic-selection` green-lit: paid product ($39) ✓ + blog post ✓ + differentiated ✓

## Session 127 (Apr 22, ~13:30 local) — GIST #11 SHIPPED: AI EMAIL PROMPTS

### ✅ Gist #11 published: AI Email Prompts cheatsheet
- 14 copy-paste templates covering replies, follow-ups, de-escalation, negotiation, apologies, thread summaries — the universal knowledge-worker email-tax surface
- Distinct from gist #02 (cold outreach); #11 focuses on inbound/reply flow where our mainstream audience lives
- Funnels: /prompt-enhancer (free, 2x) + /email-marketing-kit ($29 paid) + /blog/ai-email-templates-2026 (deep dive) + /prompt-generator (free) — diversifies revenue path vs recent image-pack-heavy gists
- Model comparison table (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5+, Gemini 2+, Llama 3+) + "Common Mistakes" + "Resources" per playbook
- UTM-tagged (9 links), IndexNow-submitted, committed to git
- Live: https://gist.github.com/manduks/a69f2fdc1110d6ee840747ca04039919 (HTTP 200 verified)

### Rationale for this topic
- Matches Session 112 audience audit (Yahoo/AOL mainstream — email is universal pain)
- Email-marketing-kit ($29) had no dedicated gist funnel yet — diversifies from image/resume-heavy catalog
- Evergreen query cluster ("chatgpt email templates", "ai email reply prompts") — not trend-dependent
- Per playbook `gist-topic-selection`: paid product exists + blog post exists + portfolio spread achieved

## Session 126 (Apr 21, ~21:00–21:20 local) — GIST #10 SHIPPED + DOUBLE-DECODE BUG VERIFIED CLEAN

### ✅ Gist #10 published: AI Resume Prompts cheatsheet
- 14 copy-paste templates for ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini covering: STAR-method bullets, ATS keyword extraction, resume-to-JD scoring, career-change pivots, executive summary, cover letters, LinkedIn About + headline, recruiter DMs, interview answers, salary negotiation, job tracker, gap explanation, reference asks
- Funnels to /resume-career-kit ($29 paid, 125+ prompts) + /prompt-enhancer (free) + existing blog post (deep dive)
- Targets evergreen demand for our mainstream Yahoo/AOL audience profile (per subscriber-audience-ads-analysis-2026-04-17.md)
- UTM-tagged + IndexNow-submitted + committed to git (9fc9d0e)
- Live: https://gist.github.com/manduks/8c60db822b19bec2e11666c7d221d3b1 (HTTP 200 verified)

### ✅ Double-decode bug TODO closed (was a false alarm)
Grepped lib/ + pages/api/ — only send-email.js had decodeURIComponent and that was already fixed in Session 125. nurture.js and keepalive.js are clean. Closing TODO 63961a19.

### ✅ /services Stripe links re-verified live (HTTP 200)

## What's Next (Session 130 priorities)

1. **Check iam@armando.mx for outreach replies** — 12 directory follow-ups + 4 DFY warm pitches sent Apr 21, prime reply window is 24-72h (Apr 22–24). Day 1 of that window already closed with no replies visible.
2. **Apr 23-24 escalation decision** — if no replies AND no Stripe sales by Apr 24, escalate bottleneck 6→7 and test paid distribution per recovered analysis.
3. **Ask Armando AGAIN for referrer analytics refresh** — 12 gists now live, 5 days since first publish. Need gist.github.com referrer data filtered by utm_campaign. This is still the highest-leverage data point blocking gist #13 selection.
4. **Gist #13 candidate (Apr 24 target if no data)** — AI Excel/Spreadsheet prompts → `/freelancer-kit` ($39) OR AI Customer Support prompts → `/small-business-kit`. Both differentiated from current 12-gist portfolio.
5. **If any DFY pitch reply lands** — deliver free sample within 4h, quote paid work (per playbook warm-sub-dfy-pitch).
6. **Consider sending 4+ more warm DFY pitches** — subscriber list blocked by /api/status auth; need Armando to either expose subs via a session-safe endpoint or paste the list.
