# Audit Replies Tracker — May 2-10 Window

**Purpose:** Log every reply to the 3 audit pitches fired Apr 28 (Hiedeh/Doug/Pham) so SLA accountability is auditable + so May 10 kill-or-iterate decision has data.

**SLAs:** 30-min ack, 4-hr deliverable on reply-type-B (sample first). See `.founder/playbooks/reply-handling-playbook.md`.

### Window status updates

- **May 2 09:00 local**: Window opens. No inbox access from this seat — Armando holds iam@armando.mx. Polling depends on him sharing replies.
- **May 2 13:42 local (T+4:42)**: No reply update from Armando. 0% reply rate at 4-hour mark. Decision: do NOT prompt him with another async ask — instead pre-build Plan A artifacts (saves 4.5 hrs from May 10 ship-day). Done: 4 artifacts created (template, intake form, page draft, broadcast email). Ship-day collapsed from 6hr → 1.5hr. See `.founder/plans/297-mini-audit-spec.md` § 9 for live checklist.
- **May 3 08:50 local (T+~24h)**: Still no reply visibility from Armando. 0/3 at the 1-day mark. Not catastrophic — IP attorneys (Pham) commonly take 5-7 days, pastors (Doug) often respond Sunday-evening or Monday. Realtor (Negar/Hiedeh) is the fastest reply ICP and 0 from her at T+24h is the most informative data point. Re-stratified the 20-sub list at $297 and wrote `.founder/deliverables/297-audience-restratification-2026-05-03.md` — key finding: Plan A and Plan B should run **in parallel** starting May 10/11, not sequential with Plan B at June 9. Decision logged for May 10 pair session.
- **May 3 09:40 local (T+24:40)**: Morning standup. Still 0/3 reply visibility. Sunday morning is a soft window — pastor traffic typically post-service. Dev.to article 3583082 (audit checklist) confirmed 0 views at day 5; April content channel triple-falsified. Fixed unrelated infra (10th jsonblob death, BLOB_ID drift, commit 613fd50). Did NOT prompt Armando about replies per `armando-async-asks` principle.

## Reply-type cheat-sheet (from playbook)

- **A — yes-interested**: send Stripe link + book discovery call within 30min
- **B — send-the-sample-first**: ack within 30min, deliver mini-assessment PDF within 4hr (use pre-staged outline)
- **C — too-expensive**: offer $297 mini-audit as fallback (Plan A SKU, **pre-built May 2** — page draft + Stripe spec + broadcast all on disk; ship-day = ~1.5hr)
- **D — not-now**: file for May 10 follow-up; ask "what would have to be true for this to be a yes in 90 days?"
- **E — hostile / unsubscribe**: one-line apology, mark do-not-contact, log

## SLA accountability

- 30-min ack window: every reply gets an acknowledgement within 30 minutes of inbox arrival, regardless of reply-type
- 4-hr deliverable window: B-type replies get the mini-assessment PDF in inbox within 4 hours of inbox arrival
- Misses get logged with the reason in the outcome column. No backdating. Honest accounting > face-saving.

## May 10 decision data

If reply-counts at May 10 09:00 local are:
- ≥1 paid sale → continue audit lever, expand cold-outbound to find more like them
- 1+ B-type sample requested but no sale → pivot positioning around what that prospect said
- 0 replies of any type → execute Plan A ($297 mini-audit, spec at `.founder/plans/297-mini-audit-spec.md`)
